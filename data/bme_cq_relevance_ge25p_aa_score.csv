Are there images of the item being used or created by the artist?,4,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia compiles details including 'multimedia content (images, videos, audio recordings, when available)' (Scenario). It also emphasizes capturing the 'history,' 'significance,' and 'Associated Artists' for 'iconic items' (Scenario, Example Data). An image of an item 'being used or created by the artist' is a prime example of such multimedia content that directly contributes to the item's history and significance, especially concerning its associated artist. The system is designed to capture 'all the details provided by Sonia' and to 'enrich the museum's knowledge base.' Furthermore, one of the questions in the user story is 'How will the system capture and store the complex history and significance of iconic items...?'; images of artists using items are a direct way to capture this. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement to know about such images, which is explicitly covered by the types of data and contextual information the system must handle."
When is a loaned item expected to be returned?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'loan agreements' are part of the information collected for each item. The 'Example Data' section further details this by including a 'Loan End Date' field within the 'Loan Agreement' for multiple example items (e.g., 'Loan End Date: 2027-12-03 (3 years)' for The Gibson J-160E Guitar). The competency question 'When is a loaned item expected to be returned?' directly addresses this explicitly mentioned 'Loan End Date' information."
Is the artefact out for repair?,3,"The user story emphasizes tracking 'condition,' 'damage,' and 'conservation history' (e.g., 'Refretted in (year),' 'Textile conservation treatment in (year)'). It also mentions that the museum might cover 'conservation costs.' Knowing if an artefact is currently 'out for repair' is a critical aspect of its present condition, its availability for display, and its ongoing conservation management. This information is directly relevant to maintaining an accurate overview of the loaned items, which is a goal for Sonia. While not explicitly stated, this status is a logical and necessary piece of information that can be inferred from the stated needs for comprehensive condition tracking and preservation management within a museum context."
What type of artist is Queen?,3,"The user story explicitly states that ""Associated Artists"" (e.g., ""Queen"") are captured as cataloguing information. The overall goal is to ""enrich the museum's knowledge base"" and facilitate ""metadata generation."" Knowing the type of an artist (e.g., whether Queen is a band, a solo artist) is a fundamental piece of metadata for an artist entity within a music-focused knowledge base. This requirement is therefore inferable using common sense and domain knowledge to make the stored artist information more complete and useful for the knowledge base."
What are the types of the artefacts that be displayed?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions that artefact information includes 'type' and provides examples such as 'Type: Acoustic-electric guitar', 'Type: Stage costume', and 'Type: Manuscript'. It also states, 'Some of these attributes apply to every item; while others are more specific to their type (e.g. the brand and type of a guitar).' Therefore, understanding the types of artefacts is an explicitly expressed requirement for the system to capture and manage artefact information correctly."
Is an item a physical object?,3,"The user story describes the loan of 'valuable and iconic items' which are treated as 'artefacts' (e.g., 'When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected'). The examples provided (guitar, jumpsuit, handwritten lyrics) are all physical objects. Furthermore, attributes like 'condition reporting,' 'display requirements,' and 'transport' are discussed, which are characteristic of physical objects. While the term 'physical object' is not explicitly used to define an 'item', the nature of items as physical objects is strongly inferable from the use of the term 'artefact', the provided examples, and the described processes, aligning with common sense and domain knowledge about museum collections."
Is an item on display?,4,"The user story explicitly raises the question of system capability: 'How will the system track the movement of loaned items between different museums and exhibitions...'. If the system tracks that an item is at an exhibition, it implies the item is on display. The goal for the donor, Sonia, is to 'showcase her items,' and the system provides her with an 'ongoing overview.' Knowing if an item is currently on display is a direct aspect of this overview and is derivable from the explicitly mentioned tracking capability related to exhibitions."
Is an item on loan or in the museum?,4,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia needs 'an ongoing overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements.' The competency question 'Is an item on loan or in the museum?' directly addresses the need to determine the current status of an item with respect to its loan agreement and its physical presence/stewardship, which are fundamental aspects of tracking the 'status of loan agreements' and providing an overview of loaned items."
When was an item acquired?,4,"The user story, specifically within the 'Example Data' section for each item (e.g., 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar'), explicitly includes a field under 'Provenance' for 'Acquired by Sonia: (Date and method of acquisition)'. This directly addresses the competency question 'When was an item acquired?'."
Who is the original manufacturer of an item?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'cataloguing information' is collected for each item. The example data for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' includes 'Brand: Gibson' under cataloguing information. 'Brand' in this context directly refers to the original manufacturer. Furthermore, the scenario mentions that 'Some of these attributes apply to every item; while others are more specific to their type (e.g. the brand and type of a guitar)', explicitly highlighting 'brand' (which implies manufacturer) as a key piece of information to be captured."
What is the insurance value of an item?,4,"The user story's 'Example Data' section, under 'Loan Agreement' for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar,' explicitly states: 'Insurance: BME to provide insurance for the full value of the guitar.' This directly indicates that the 'insurance value' or 'full value' of an item is a piece of information that needs to be captured as part of the loan agreement details. Other examples also mention insurance or appraised value, reinforcing this requirement."
Does the item display any damage or defect?,4,"The user story explicitly states that when adding a new item, its 'condition' is collected. The 'Example Data' section further clarifies this by providing a 'Description of any damage' for each item (e.g., 'Minor scratches on the body, replaced tuning pegs' for the Gibson J-160E Guitar). The competency question 'Does the item display any damage or defect?' directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement to document damages as part of an item's condition."
Is the item related to other artefacts in the museum?,4,"The user story, through its 'Example Data' (which details 'the type of information... that needs to be captured'), explicitly requires the system to capture 'Associated Artists' and 'Associated Works' as part of an item's 'Cataloguing information.' The stated goal is 'automatic generation of metadata to enrich the museum's knowledge base.' If an item loaned by Sonia has an 'Associated Artist' (e.g., John Lennon) that is also associated with other artefacts already in the museum's knowledge base, then Sonia's item *is* related to those other artefacts through this shared association. The competency question 'Is the item related to other artefacts in the museum?' directly addresses the system's ability to recognize and utilize these explicitly captured associations to establish relationships within the enriched knowledge base. This capability is a direct outcome of fulfilling the explicit requirements for data capture and knowledge base enrichment with this specific type of relational information."
How many items related to Queen does the museum own?,3,"The user story describes the creation and enrichment of a museum's knowledge base, which includes cataloguing information like ""Associated Artist"" (e.g., ""Queen"" in the example data). The example data also indicates that loaned items can become ""full donation[s],"" meaning the museum would own them and this information would be part of the knowledge base. A fundamental purpose of a knowledge base, especially one used by a museum manager (like Liz, a persona in the user story), is to be queryable. Therefore, the ability to count items owned by the museum related to a specific artist can be inferred as a requirement using common sense and domain knowledge about museum collection management systems and knowledge bases. This query directly leverages the data explicitly mentioned as being captured and managed by the system."
How many items of type manuscript does the museum own?,3,"The user story describes a system for managing items loaned to the museum, which are added to the museum's 'knowledge base' and 'collection'. The example data explicitly includes an item of 'Type: Manuscript' and a 'Loan Agreement' that allows for 'Full donation,' implying the museum can take ownership of such items. If the museum's knowledge base, populated via this system, contains information about owned items and their types, it is a common-sense inference from museum collection management domain knowledge that the system should support queries about the count of such items. This capability is a fundamental aspect of managing a collection and utilizing a knowledge base, making the competency question relevant as an inferred requirement."
What are the different types of display requirements?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are collected as part of the information for an artifact. The 'Example Data' section further elaborates on this by providing structured examples of display requirements for different items. These examples are itemized with clear labels such as 'Display case:', 'Lighting:', 'Handling:', 'Security:', 'Mannequin:', 'Environment:', and 'Framing:'. These labels directly correspond to 'different types of display requirements.' Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement (the need to identify and understand these types) that is explicitly demonstrated and itemized within the user story's provided examples."
Who is responsible for the acquisition of an item in the museum?,4,"The user story explicitly describes Liz, the museum manager, as the one who 'carefully reviews each item,' where 'a selection of items is identified' (implying her decision-making role), and who then 'utilises the BME dashboard to systematically add each item to the knowledge base.' These explicitly stated actions are central to the museum's process of acquiring (in this context, accepting on loan) an item, thereby directly addressing who is responsible for these critical steps in the acquisition process described."
What is the type of association between an artefact and an artist?,4,"The user story explicitly requires capturing 'Associated Artists' as part of 'Cataloguing information' (Example Data). It also mandates capturing 'Associated Works', 'Associated Events', and the 'complex history and significance' of items. These pieces of information collectively define and describe the *type* of association between an artefact and an artist (e.g., an artist played an instrument on a specific album, wore a costume during a particular tour, or created a manuscript). The competency question asks for this type, and the system is explicitly required to capture the information that determines this type. The user story's question, 'How will the system capture and store the complex history and significance of iconic items...', further implies that the nature (type) of such associations is a critical piece of information to be captured."
What artist is the item associated with?,4,"The user story explicitly lists 'Associated Artists' or 'Associated Artist' as a key piece of 'Cataloguing information' in all three provided 'Example Data' instances (e.g., 'Associated Artists: John Lennon, George Harrison' for the Gibson guitar; 'Associated Artist: David Bowie' for the jumpsuit). The competency question directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement for capturing artist information associated with an item."
Is an item an original or a copy?,3,"The user story focuses on loaning ""valuable and iconic items"" and capturing their ""provenance"" and ""cataloguing information."" In a museum context, determining whether an item is an original or a copy is a fundamental aspect of its identity, value, and provenance. While not explicitly stated in the exact words, this distinction is strongly implied by the emphasis on these aspects and can be inferred through common sense and domain knowledge about museum collections and the nature of iconic artifacts. The system would need to capture this information to accurately document the items as described."
How was an item acquired?,4,The user story explicitly mentions that 'provenance' is a key piece of information collected for each item. The provided example data for artifacts like 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' and 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit' further details under 'Provenance' the field 'Acquired by Sonia: (Date and method of acquisition)'. The competency question 'How was an item acquired?' directly addresses this 'method of acquisition' which is an explicit requirement for documenting an item's provenance.
What organisation borrowed an item?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'loan agreements' are part of the information collected for an item. The 'Example Data' section provides concrete examples of 'Loan Agreement' details, which include a 'Borrower' field specifying the organisation (e.g., 'Borrower: British Music Experience (BME)'). The competency question 'What organisation borrowed an item?' directly addresses this explicitly mentioned data point."
Is an item on loan?,4,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia can maintain an 'ongoing overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements.' Determining if an item is currently 'on loan' is a fundamental aspect of its loan status and is directly covered by the system's requirement to manage and display information about 'loaned items' and their 'loan agreements,' including start and end dates as shown in the example data."
Is an item currently in the museum?,4,"The user story explicitly states that the system should 'track the movement of loaned items between different museums and exhibitions' (under the 'Questions' section, which highlights system capabilities) and that Sonia should be able to 'maintain an ongoing overview of her loaned items'. Knowing whether an item is 'currently in the museum' is a fundamental piece of information required for tracking its movement and providing such an overview. Therefore, the competency question directly addresses a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story."
How should an item of type manuscript be displayed?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are collected for each item. Furthermore, it provides a detailed example of a 'Manuscript' item ('Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""') and lists its specific 'Display Requirements,' directly addressing the information sought by the competency question."
How should an item of type guitar be displayed?,4,"The user story explicitly states that ""display requirements"" are among the various pieces of information collected for an artifact when it's added to the knowledge base (Scenario: ""When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... display requirements...""). Furthermore, the ""Example Data"" section provides a detailed list of ""Display Requirements"" for ""The Gibson J-160E Guitar."" The competency question ""How should an item of type guitar be displayed?"" directly asks for this specific information, which the system is explicitly required to capture and manage. The question at the end of the user story, ""Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item..."", further reinforces this explicit requirement."
Are there display requirements for an item?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'display requirements' multiple times. In the 'Scenario' section, it states that when adding an item, 'various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... display requirements...'. The 'Example Data' section provides detailed 'Display Requirements' for each listed item. Furthermore, one of the 'Questions' at the end of the user story is 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item...?'. The competency question directly addresses this explicitly stated need for the system to handle display requirements."
Is an item loaned or donated?,4,"The user story, specifically within the ""Example Data"" section for ""Loan Agreement"" details, explicitly mentions ""full donation"" as a possible term (e.g., for the Gibson J-160E Guitar: ""Compensation: ... (or 'indefinite loan,' or 'full donation')""; for David Bowie's Jumpsuit: ""Loan End Date: Indefinite (or specific date, or 'full donation')""; for Handwritten Lyrics: ""Loan End Date: Full donation (or specific date)""). This indicates that the system must be able to distinguish whether an item is loaned or donated. The competency question ""Is an item loaned or donated?"" directly addresses this explicitly expressed requirement."
What are the loan conditions?,4,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia provides ""proposed loan terms"" and the system captures ""loan agreements"". The ""Example Data"" section further details the components of a ""Loan Agreement"" for several items (e.g., Loan Start Date, Loan End Date, Compensation, Insurance, Transport), which are precisely the ""loan conditions"" the competency question asks about. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement that is explicitly expressed and detailed in the user story."
What are the preservation requirements for an item?,4,"The user story explicitly addresses the need to manage preservation-related information. The museum's mission is stated as ""preserving British music heritage."" More specifically, one of the questions defining the system's scope is: ""Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item, ensuring its proper handling and preservation?"" The competency question ""What are the preservation requirements for an item?"" directly asks for the information that this explicitly stated system requirement implies needs to be captured and managed. Furthermore, the ""Example Data"" section details ""Display Requirements"" (e.g., climate control, UV-filtered lighting, handling instructions) which are concrete examples of preservation requirements for an item."
What is the condition of an item?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'condition reporting' in its keywords, states that the donor (Sonia) provides the 'current condition' of items, and that the system collects 'condition' as part of an artifact's information. The example data for each item also includes a detailed 'Condition' section. Therefore, the competency question directly addresses a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story."
Who is the insurance company insuring an item,3,"The user story explicitly states that insurance is part of the loan agreement (e.g., 'BME to provide insurance for the full value of the guitar'). While the specific name of the 'insurance company' is not explicitly listed as a data point to capture, knowing the actual underwriting company is a critical detail that can be inferred using common sense and domain knowledge regarding loan agreements for valuable items. For comprehensive documentation and transparency (goals mentioned in the user story), identifying the insurance company is a necessary piece of information related to the stated insurance provision."
Who loaned an item,4,"The user story explicitly identifies Sonia as the individual loaning items to the BME ('Sonia wants to seamlessly loan valuable and iconic items from her collection to the BME'). The system is designed to manage these loans and allows Sonia to 'maintain an ongoing overview of her loaned items,' which directly implies the system must know and store information about who loaned each item. Additionally, the system is described as capturing 'loan agreements,' and identifying the lender is a fundamental component of any loan agreement."
What is the insurance status of an item?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'Insurance' as a component of the 'Loan Agreement' in all three provided examples (e.g., 'BME to provide insurance for the full value of the guitar'). The competency question directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement."
What are the features of an item of type guitar,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'Some of these attributes apply to every item; while others are more specific to their type (e.g. the brand and type of a guitar).' It then provides detailed example data for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar,' listing specific features such as Type, Brand, Model, and Serial Number. The competency question 'What are the features of an item of type guitar' directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement to capture type-specific features for guitars."
When was the item first purchased,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'provenance' information for artifacts must be captured (e.g., 'When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... provenance...'). The example data for 'Provenance' for the Gibson J-160E Guitar includes 'Originally purchased by: (Original owner, if known)'. The competency question 'When was the item first purchased' directly asks for a key piece of information that constitutes the item's provenance and history, specifically related to its original acquisition. Therefore, it addresses a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story through the need to document provenance."
Does an item have a brand associated with it,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'brand' as an attribute of an item. In the scenario, it states: 'Some of these attributes apply to every item; while others are more specific to their type (e.g. the brand and type of a guitar).' Furthermore, the 'Example Data' for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' includes 'Brand: Gibson' under 'Cataloguing information'."
What is the type of artefact is the item “Gibson J-160E”,4,"The user story explicitly states that when adding a new item, 'various information of the artefact is collected, including: cataloguing information'. It further clarifies that some attributes are 'specific to their type (e.g. the brand and type of a guitar)'. The 'Example Data' section for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' explicitly lists its 'Type: Acoustic-electric guitar' under 'Cataloguing information'. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement (knowing the type of an artefact) that is explicitly expressed and exemplified in the user story."
Where can an item be sent for repairs?,3,"The user story explicitly asks if the system will record 'care instructions for each item, ensuring its proper handling and preservation.' Common sense and domain knowledge suggest that care instructions for valuable and iconic items would likely include information or stipulations about where or by whom repairs should be conducted (e.g., approved conservators or specialists). Therefore, the competency question 'Where can an item be sent for repairs?' addresses a requirement that can be inferred from the need to capture comprehensive care instructions. Furthermore, information about past repairs (including location) would be part of the 'conservation history,' and tracking an item sent for repair would be relevant to 'tracking the movement of loaned items,' both of which are mentioned in the user story."
How can the item be displayed? (An original recording?),4,"The user story explicitly states multiple times that ""display requirements"" are a crucial piece of information to be captured for each loaned item. For instance, the scenario mentions, ""When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... display requirements..."" and the example data for each item includes a detailed ""Display Requirements"" section. The competency question ""How can the item be displayed?"" directly inquires about these explicitly mentioned requirements."
Is an item one of many items of the same types?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'cataloguing information' including 'type' (e.g., 'Type: Acoustic-electric guitar', 'Type: Stage costume') is collected for each item. Furthermore, the example data for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' includes a 'Serial Number: (Unique identifier)', which is used to distinguish individual instances of a product type that can have multiple instances. The requirement to capture and manage items with specific types, and to distinguish individual instances (like those with serial numbers), means the system is explicitly designed to handle situations where multiple items of the same type exist. The competency question 'Is an item one of many items of the same types?' directly addresses this explicitly managed data structure by asking about the multiplicity of items for a given type, which is a fundamental aspect of cataloguing such items in the described knowledge base."
Are there requirements for an item to be returned?,4,"The user story explicitly states that the system captures 'loan agreements' (under 'Scenario': ""When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... loan agreements, etc.""). The example data for loan agreements includes 'Loan End Date'. The 'Loan End Date' and other 'loan terms' (mentioned in Sonia's information compilation) directly constitute requirements for an item to be returned (e.g., when the loan period expires). Therefore, the competency question, which asks if such requirements exist, addresses a need that is explicitly covered by the system's function of capturing and managing loan agreement details."
What kind of metadata was provided for a loaned item when first acquired?,4,"The user story explicitly details the kinds of metadata that are provided by the donor (Sonia) and captured by the museum system (Liz) when an item is first acquired for loan. The US states, ""When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: cataloguing information, provenance, condition, display requirements, loan agreements, etc."" The Example Data section further elaborates on these kinds of metadata. The competency question directly asks to identify these types of metadata, which are explicitly enumerated and described in the user story."
Does an item have a full history associated with it,4,"The user story explicitly states that the system needs to capture and store the 'history' and 'provenance' of items. For instance, Sonia 'compiles the details of these items, including their history,' and the system is intended for 'artifact documentation' and capturing 'provenance.' The example data provided includes sections for 'Provenance' (e.g., original owner, acquisition details, previous loans) and 'Conservation history.' Additionally, one of the key questions within the user story is: 'How will the system capture and store the complex history and significance of iconic items...'. The competency question 'Does an item have a full history associated with it' directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement."
What is the alias of a music artist?,3,"The user story requires cataloging ""Associated Artists"" for music memorabilia, providing examples like ""David Bowie."" In the music domain, artists frequently use stage names or other aliases (e.g., ""David Bowie"" is the stage name for David Robert Jones). Therefore, the ability to identify and retrieve an artist's alias is a requirement that can be directly inferred using common sense and domain knowledge to accurately represent artist information and enrich the knowledge base. The competency question ""What is the alias of a music artist?"" addresses this inferred need."
What is the name of a music artist?,4,"The user story, specifically within the 'Example Data' section, explicitly mentions 'Associated Artists' as a key piece of cataloguing information for items like 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' (Associated Artists: John Lennon, George Harrison), 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit' (Associated Artist: David Bowie), and 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""' (Associated Artist: Queen). The competency question 'What is the name of a music artist?' directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement to capture artist names."
What role did a music artist play within a music ensemble?,3,"The user story focuses on capturing comprehensive details about iconic music memorabilia, including 'cataloguing information,' 'history,' and 'significance' to enrich a knowledge base (S1 Goal, Scenario, Questions). The example data explicitly lists 'Associated Artists' (e.g., John Lennon, George Harrison, who were part of The Beatles; Queen, which is an ensemble) and 'Associated Works' (e.g., Beatles albums). The competency question 'What role did a music artist play within a music ensemble?' seeks to capture a specific attribute of these artists – their function within their musical group. This information is fundamental to understanding the artist's contribution, the context of the associated works, and thus the 'significance' of related memorabilia. While not explicitly stated as 'capture artist role,' the requirement to record such information is strongly inferable using domain knowledge about music cataloging and the user story's emphasis on creating a rich and detailed knowledge base about music heritage, as highlighted by the user story question 'How will the system capture and store the complex history and significance of iconic items...?'."
Who are the members of a a music ensemble?,4,"The user story explicitly requires capturing ""Associated Artists"" as part of the cataloguing information. The provided ""Example Data"" for ""The Gibson J-160E Guitar"" lists ""Associated Artists: John Lennon, George Harrison."" These individuals are members of the music ensemble The Beatles. This example explicitly demonstrates that the system must handle information about individual members of music ensembles as ""Associated Artists."" The competency question ""Who are the members of a music ensemble?"" directly addresses the system's capability to provide this type of information, which is shown to be a required piece of data within the user story."
Who is the composer of a music work?,4,"The user story specifies that ""cataloguing information"" is collected, and provides ""Example Data"" to illustrate this. One explicit example is ""Handwritten Lyrics for 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Freddie Mercury."" This data point directly indicates the creator of the musical work (lyrics, and by common knowledge, Freddie Mercury is also the composer of the song ""Bohemian Rhapsody""). The competency question ""Who is the composer of a music work?"" directly addresses the need to capture this type of information, which is explicitly exemplified as a required piece of data in the user story."
Who is the designer of a costume?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions the need to capture 'cataloguing information' for artifacts. In the 'Example Data' section, for 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit' (which is a costume), the 'Cataloguing information' explicitly includes 'Designer: Kansai Yamamoto'. Therefore, the competency question 'Who is the designer of a costume?' directly addresses a requirement that is explicitly expressed in the user story through its example data."
Which is the serial number of an instrument?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'Serial Number' as part of the 'Cataloguing information' for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' in the 'Example Data' section. An instrument is a type of artifact, and the CQ directly asks for this explicitly listed piece of information."
Which is the model of an instrument?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'Model' is a piece of cataloguing information to be captured for an artifact. This is demonstrated in the 'Example Data' section for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar', where 'Model: J-160E' is listed under 'Cataloguing information'. The system is designed to capture such details."
What is the brand of an instrument?,4,"The user story explicitly states that when adding a new item, 'various information of the artefact is collected, including: cataloguing information... Some of these attributes apply to every item; while others are more specific to their type (e.g. the brand and type of a guitar).' Furthermore, the 'Example Data' for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' explicitly lists 'Brand: Gibson' under 'Cataloguing information.' The competency question directly asks for this explicitly mentioned piece of information."
What is the family of an instrument?,3,"The user story states that 'cataloguing information' is collected, and provides 'type of a guitar' as an example of specific information for an item. In the domain of musical instruments, 'family' (e.g., strings, woodwind, brass, percussion) is a fundamental and standard part of cataloguing and classification, closely related to 'type'. For a system designed to 'enrich the museum's knowledge base' with 'metadata generation' for musical items for the British Music Experience, the requirement to know an instrument's family can be reasonably inferred using domain knowledge about musicology and museum cataloguing practices. It is a natural and expected piece of metadata for classifying musical instruments."
What is the size of an item?,3,"The user story explicitly states that 'cataloguing information' and 'display requirements' are collected for each artifact. The size of an item is a standard component of cataloguing information for physical objects in a museum context. Furthermore, determining 'display requirements' (such as a 'custom-fit mannequin' for the jumpsuit or 'framing' for the lyrics, both mentioned in the examples) inherently necessitates knowing the item's dimensions. Therefore, the competency question 'What is the size of an item?' addresses a requirement that can be inferred from the user story using common sense and domain knowledge about museum collections management."
What is the current condition of an item?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions the need to capture and manage the 'current condition' of items. This is highlighted in the keywords ('condition reporting'), the scenario (Sonia provides 'current condition'; Liz collects 'condition' information), the detailed example data for each item (which includes a 'Condition' section), and one of the concluding questions ('How will the system facilitate the creation of condition reports...'). The competency question 'What is the current condition of an item?' directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement."
Which materials is the item made of?,4,"The user story requires the system to capture detailed ""Condition"" information for artifacts. The provided ""Example Data"" explicitly includes material information within the ""Condition"" descriptions, such as ""fading of the fabric"" for David Bowie's jumpsuit and ""foxing of the paper"" for the handwritten lyrics. The competency question ""Which materials is the item made of?"" directly queries this type of information, which the user story shows is an explicit part of the data to be captured by the system. Additionally, the system is meant to capture ""cataloguing information"" and ""display requirements,"" both of which would typically include or depend on knowing the item's materials."
In which year was the item produced?,3,"The user story explicitly states that the system will capture the 'history' and 'cataloguing information' of the loaned items. The competency question 'In which year was the item produced?' directly pertains to a fundamental aspect of an item's history and is a standard piece of cataloguing information, especially for 'iconic items' and 'music memorabilia' as described. This can be inferred using common sense and domain knowledge in museum curation and artifact documentation. Furthermore, the example data includes other year-specific details (e.g., 'Refretted in (year)', 'Ziggy Stardust tour (year)'), indicating the relevance of capturing such chronological information."
What are the specific light level requirements for the item?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions that 'display requirements' are collected when adding an item to the knowledge base. The 'Example Data' section provides concrete examples of these display requirements, including specific 'Lighting' needs for each item (e.g., 'Low-level, UV-filtered lighting,' 'Indirect, low-level lighting'). The competency question 'What are the specific light level requirements for the item?' directly addresses this explicitly stated and exemplified requirement."
What are the specific humidity requirements for the item?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are collected for each item. The 'Example Data' section further clarifies this by including 'humidity control' and 'stable temperature and humidity' as specific examples under 'Display Requirements' for artifacts. Additionally, a question within the user story asks, 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item...'. The competency question, 'What are the specific humidity requirements for the item?', directly asks for a detail that is explicitly part of these 'display requirements' that the system is intended to capture and manage."
What are the specific temperature requirements for the item?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' for items will be recorded (e.g., 'When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... display requirements'; 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item...'). The provided examples for 'Display Requirements' include 'climate-controlled display case,' 'climate-controlled environment with humidity control,' and 'stable temperature and humidity.' The competency question 'What are the specific temperature requirements for the item?' directly asks for a crucial detail necessary to define and implement these explicitly mentioned temperature-related display requirements. Therefore, it addresses a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story."
Does the item have any display requirements?,4,"The user story explicitly states in the scenario that when adding a new item, 'display requirements' are collected ('When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: cataloguing information, provenance, condition, display requirements, loan agreements, etc.'). Furthermore, the 'Example Data' section provides detailed 'Display Requirements' for each listed item, and one of the 'Questions' at the end of the user story is 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item...'. The competency question 'Does the item have any display requirements?' directly addresses this explicitly expressed requirement."
What is the agreed-upon value of the item for insurance purposes?,4,"The user story explicitly states that when adding an item, 'loan agreements' are collected. The 'Example Data' section further clarifies this by showing, under 'Loan Agreement' for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar', the detail 'Insurance: BME to provide insurance for the full value of the guitar.' For the 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""', it mentions 'Compensation: Tax deduction for the appraised value'. The competency question 'What is the agreed-upon value of the item for insurance purposes?' directly asks for this 'full value' or 'appraised value', which is explicitly indicated as a piece of information to be captured as part of the loan agreement details."
What is the estimated value of the item?,4,"The user story's example data, which explicitly details the information to be captured and managed, includes financial values related to items. Specifically, for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar', the loan agreement states 'Insurance: BME to provide insurance for the full value of the guitar,' and for the 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""', it mentions 'Compensation: Tax deduction for the appraised value'. The competency question 'What is the estimated value of the item?' directly addresses this requirement to know and store the item's value (be it 'full value' or 'appraised value'), which is explicitly expressed within the provided examples of data the system must handle."
When does the lend of the item end?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'loan agreements' as part of the information to be captured. The 'Example Data' section further details 'Loan Agreement' attributes, including 'Loan End Date' for multiple items. The competency question 'When does the lend of the item end?' directly corresponds to this 'Loan End Date' information, which is explicitly part of the system's requirements as illustrated by the examples."
When does the lend of the item start?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions that 'loan agreements' are part of the information collected when adding an item. The 'Example Data' section, which is an integral part of the user story, provides specific examples of loan agreements, and each example includes a 'Loan Start Date'. The competency question 'When does the lend of the item start?' directly corresponds to this 'Loan Start Date' attribute, which is explicitly shown as data to be captured."
Who is the current lender of an item?,4,"The user story explicitly states 'Sonia wants to seamlessly loan valuable and iconic items from her collection...'. This directly identifies Sonia as the lender. The system's purpose is to facilitate these loans and manage 'loan agreements,' which are explicitly mentioned as information to be captured. For the system to manage loans initiated by Sonia and allow her to track 'her loaned items' (also explicitly mentioned), it must know that Sonia is the lender of those items. Therefore, the competency question 'Who is the current lender of an item?' addresses a requirement that is explicitly expressed in the user story."
How was the item acquired by the museum?,4,"The user story explicitly states that ""loan agreements"" are captured when an item is added to the museum's collection (""When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... loan agreements, etc.""). The provided example data for ""Loan Agreement"" details the borrower (BME) and terms of acquisition (e.g., loan duration, compensation, or ""full donation""). This information directly answers the competency question ""How was the item acquired by the museum?"". Therefore, the requirement for the system to store and provide this information is explicitly expressed in the user story."
What is the documented history of ownership of the item?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'provenance' as a key piece of information to be collected for each item (Scenario: ""When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: cataloguing information, provenance...""). The example data further details what provenance includes, such as ""Originally purchased by,"" ""Originally owned by,"" and ""Acquired by Sonia,"" all of which directly relate to the documented history of ownership. Therefore, the competency question directly addresses an explicitly stated requirement."
"Was this item ever featured in a significant publication (magazine, book, newspaper)?",3,"The user story explicitly states the goal of capturing the ""history"" and ""significance"" of ""iconic items"" (e.g., Sonia compiles details including ""history, significance""; a question asks ""How will the system capture and store the complex history and significance of iconic items...""). Being featured in a significant publication is a key aspect that contributes to an item's history and establishes its significance, especially for iconic items. While the user story does not list ""publication features"" as an explicit data field in the examples, it is a type of information that can be reasonably inferred, using common sense and domain knowledge, as necessary for comprehensively documenting an iconic item's history and significance. The example data includes ""Associated Works"" (e.g., an album), which is related to publications, further supporting that information about an item's connection to published material is relevant."
Was the item involved in any significant historical events besides performances?,4,"The user story explicitly states that the system must capture the 'history' and 'significance' of iconic items. Furthermore, the 'Example Data' section, which is an integral part of the user story, provides a concrete example under 'Cataloguing information' for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' which lists 'Associated Works: ""Please Please Me"" album'. The creation of an album, or an item's involvement in it, is a significant historical event that is distinct from a live performance. The competency question 'Was the item involved in any significant historical events besides performances?' directly addresses the system's capability to store and retrieve this type of historical information, which is explicitly exemplified in the user story's data requirements."
Was an item used during a music performance?,4,"The user story explicitly requires the system to capture detailed cataloguing information for music memorabilia. The 'Example Data' section, provided to 'illustrate the type of information,' includes fields such as 'Associated Works' (e.g., '""Please Please Me"" album') for a guitar and 'Associated Event' (e.g., 'Ziggy Stardust tour') for a stage costume. These examples directly indicate that information about an item's use in music recordings (a form of performance) or live performances (like a tour) is a required piece of data to be captured. The competency question 'Was an item used during a music performance?' directly addresses this explicitly exemplified requirement to document an item's performance history as part of its cataloguing information and overall significance."
Was an item owned by a music artist?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'provenance' information is collected for each item. The provided 'Example Data' (which is part of the user story) for items like 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit' and 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""' includes fields such as 'Provenance: Originally owned by: David Bowie' and 'Provenance: Originally owned by: Freddie Mercury (or his estate)'. This information directly answers the competency question 'Was an item owned by a music artist?'. Additionally, 'Cataloguing information' includes 'Associated Artists', which is also directly relevant. The requirement to capture such details is therefore explicitly expressed."
Was an item produced by a music artist?,4,"The user story, particularly in its ""Example Data"" section, explicitly shows that information about the creator/producer of an item is to be captured. For instance, the example ""Handwritten Lyrics for 'Bohemian Rhapsody'"" includes the detail ""by Freddie Mercury"" in its description. Since Freddie Mercury is a music artist, this demonstrates an explicit requirement for the system to store information that directly answers whether an item was produced by a music artist. The system is designed to capture ""cataloguing information"" and ""provenance,"" and identifying the producer (who in this case is a music artist) is a fundamental part of this explicitly illustrated requirement."
Was an item used by a music artist?,4,"The user story, particularly in its ""Example Data"" section, explicitly lists ""Associated Artists"" as a key piece of cataloguing information for music memorabilia (e.g., ""Associated Artists: John Lennon, George Harrison"" for the Gibson J-160E Guitar; ""Associated Artist: David Bowie"" for the Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit). The competency question ""Was an item used by a music artist?"" directly addresses the need to capture this specific information, as knowing this is essential for identifying and recording the associated artists."
Which music releases are associated to a given item?,4,"The user story, particularly in the 'Example Data' section, explicitly details the type of information to be captured for items. For 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar,' under 'Cataloguing information,' it lists 'Associated Works: ""Please Please Me"" album'. An album is a form of music release. Similarly, for the 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"",' the 'Associated Work' is the song '""Bohemian Rhapsody"",' which is intrinsically linked to a music release. Therefore, the competency question directly addresses a requirement explicitly expressed through these examples within the user story."
Which events are associated to a given item?,4,"The user story, specifically in the 'Example Data' section for 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit,' explicitly lists 'Associated Event: Ziggy Stardust tour (year)' as a piece of information to be captured for an item. The competency question 'Which events are associated to a given item?' directly addresses the need to retrieve this explicitly mentioned type of information."
Which music performances are associated to an item?,4,"The user story, through its ""Example Data"" section, explicitly lists ""Associated Event: Ziggy Stardust tour"" and ""Associated Works: 'Please Please Me' album"" as part of the ""Cataloguing information"" for items like the 'Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit' and 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar'. A tour is a series of music performances, and an album is a collection of recorded music performances. The user story states that this type of information needs to be captured and managed. Therefore, the competency question about which music performances are associated with an item addresses a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story."
Which music works are associated to an item?,4,"The user story's ""Example Data"" section explicitly lists ""Associated Works"" as part of the ""Cataloguing information"" for items (e.g., The Gibson J-160E Guitar is associated with the ""Please Please Me"" album, and the Handwritten Lyrics are associated with the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" song). The competency question ""Which music works are associated to an item?"" directly addresses the need to retrieve this explicitly mentioned piece of information."
Which music artists are associated to an item?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions that 'cataloguing information' is collected for each item. The 'Example Data' section, which is part of the user story, provides concrete examples of this cataloguing information, such as 'Associated Artists: John Lennon, George Harrison' for the Gibson J-160E Guitar, 'Associated Artist: David Bowie' for the jumpsuit, and 'Associated Artist: Queen' for the handwritten lyrics. The competency question 'Which music artists are associated to an item?' directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement to capture and store information about associated music artists for an item."
Are there any copyright restrictions on the multimedia files?,3,"The user story explicitly mentions that Sonia provides ""multimedia content (images, videos, audio recordings, when available)"" as part of the item details. For the museum to effectively use this multimedia content to ""enrich the museum's knowledge base"" and facilitate ""knowledge exchange,"" understanding any copyright restrictions is essential. This requirement can be inferred using common sense and domain knowledge regarding museum practices, intellectual property rights, and the responsible use of digital assets. Information about usage rights, including copyright, is a standard consideration when incorporating such materials into a collection or knowledge system."
What is the resolution or quality of each multimedia file?,3,"The user story states that Sonia provides 'multimedia content (images, videos, audio recordings, when available)' and that the system supports 'automatic generation of metadata to enrich the museum's knowledge base' and ensures 'accurate documentation'. Knowing the resolution or quality of multimedia files is a fundamental and standard piece of metadata for such files. This information is crucial for the museum to understand the usability (e.g., for display, print, research), archival value, and preservation needs of the multimedia content. Therefore, the requirement to capture resolution or quality can be inferred from the user story using common sense (understanding the utility of a digital file often depends on its quality) and domain knowledge (museums and archives routinely capture technical metadata for digital assets)."
What is the format of each multimedia file?,3,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia provides ""multimedia content (images, videos, audio recordings, when available)"" (Scenario section) and a key goal is ""automatic generation of metadata to enrich the museum's knowledge base"" (Goal section). For the system to effectively manage, process, display, or perform automatic metadata generation on these multimedia files, it is essential to know their format (e.g., JPEG, MP4, MP3). This requirement is directly inferable using common sense and fundamental domain knowledge in digital asset management and information systems, as knowing the file format is a prerequisite for any meaningful interaction with multimedia content within the described system."
Give me all the videos associated to a given item,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'multimedia content (images, videos, audio recordings, when available)' is part of the item details compiled by the donor (Sonia) and 'accurately captured within the system' by the manager (Liz) to enrich the museum's knowledge base. The competency question 'Give me all the videos associated to a given item' directly addresses the requirement to access and retrieve this explicitly mentioned type of multimedia content that the system is designed to capture and manage for knowledge exchange purposes."
Give me all the audio recordings associated to a given item,4,"The user story explicitly states in the scenario that Sonia, the donor, compiles details of the items including 'multimedia content (images, videos, audio recordings, when available)'. It also mentions that Liz, the manager, 'diligently ensures that all the details provided by Sonia are accurately captured within the system.' Therefore, the system is required to handle audio recordings. The competency question 'Give me all the audio recordings associated to a given item' directly addresses the need to retrieve this explicitly mentioned and captured data."
Which is the primary image of the item if available?,3,"The user story states that Sonia provides 'multimedia content (images, videos, audio recordings, when available)' for her items. The use of 'images' (plural) implies that an item can have multiple images. In systems designed to showcase items and provide overviews (as described for the museum's knowledge base and Sonia's dashboard access), it is a common and sensible practice to designate one image as 'primary' for display and identification if multiple images are available. Therefore, the competency question about identifying the primary image addresses a requirement that can be inferred from the user story using common sense and domain knowledge about digital asset management and collection display."
Give me all the images associated to a given item,4,"The user story explicitly states that item details include 'multimedia content (images...)' which are 'accurately captured within the system'. Additionally, it mentions the system should facilitate 'upload[ing] photographs' for condition reports. The competency question 'Give me all the images associated to a given item' directly addresses the requirement to access this explicitly mentioned and captured data. Retrieving data that is explicitly stated to be stored and managed by the system is a fundamental aspect of the requirements expressed in the user story."
To which specific period or era does this item belong?,4,"The user story explicitly states that the system will capture 'cataloguing information' and 'provenance.' The provided 'Example Data' section, which illustrates the 'level of detail' the system must accommodate, includes fields like 'Associated Works: ""Please Please Me"" album (and other early Beatles recordings)' and 'Associated Event: Ziggy Stardust tour (year)'. This type of information directly defines or allows for the determination of the specific period or era to which an item belongs. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement to access information that is explicitly part of the data the system is designed to manage."
To which music genres can this item be associated?,3,"The user story aims to capture comprehensive details about music memorabilia for the BME's knowledge base, explicitly mentioning ""cataloguing information"" and ""metadata generation."" Music genre is a fundamental aspect of cataloguing music-related artifacts, especially for a museum dedicated to ""British music heritage."" While not explicitly listed as a field in the examples, it's strongly inferable from the context (music museum, music memorabilia) and from explicitly mentioned fields like ""Associated Artists"" and ""Associated Works"" (e.g., John Lennon's work implies rock/pop genres). Knowing the genre is crucial for understanding an item's significance and enriching the knowledge base, aligning with the user story's goals. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement that can be inferred using common sense and domain knowledge about musicology and museum practices."
Are there any items in the collection related to this item?,4,"The user story states the goal is to 'enrich the museum's knowledge base' and explicitly details that 'Cataloguing information,' including relational attributes like 'Associated Artists' and 'Associated Works,' will be captured for each item (as shown in the example data). A 'knowledge base,' by its nature, is designed to store not just data but also the relationships between data points, and to make these relationships queryable. The competency question 'Are there any items in the collection related to this item?' directly asks about this fundamental capability: to query the relationships (e.g., shared artist, shared work) that are explicitly defined by the captured data. Therefore, the ability to find related items is an explicit requirement for the system to function as an 'enriched knowledge base' as described in the user story, utilizing explicitly mentioned data types."
Is this item part of a larger set?,3,"The user story emphasizes comprehensive artifact documentation, knowledge exchange, and the generation of rich metadata for the museum's knowledge base. It explicitly mentions capturing 'cataloguing information'. In museum and collections management (domain knowledge), identifying whether an item is part of a larger set (e.g., a pair, a series, items from the same original collection or event) is a fundamental aspect of cataloguing. This information contributes significantly to an item's context, history, and significance, which the user story aims to capture. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement that can be inferred from the user story using common sense and domain knowledge about museum practices."
What is the caption of the item that is displayed at the museum?,3,"The user story specifies that Sonia wants to 'showcase her items' and is 'passionate about sharing her collection with the public.' The system is designed for 'knowledge exchange' and to capture detailed 'artifact documentation,' including 'cataloguing information' (e.g., type, description, associated artists/works) and 'significance.' Common sense and museum domain knowledge dictate that items displayed to the public are accompanied by captions or labels that convey such information. The user story also mentions the system should 'provide a clear, organised way to track and communicate this information.' Therefore, the ability for the system to provide the content for a caption for a displayed item is a requirement that can be inferred from the user story."
What is the main textual description associated to an item?,4,"The user story, through its 'Example Data' section, explicitly shows that items have a 'Description' field as part of their 'Cataloguing information' (e.g., for David Bowie's Jumpsuit: 'Description: One-piece jumpsuit...' and for Handwritten Lyrics: 'Description: Handwritten lyrics...'). This 'Description' field directly corresponds to the 'main textual description' sought by the competency question. The user story further states, 'These examples demonstrate the range of information that needs to be captured and managed... The new system should be able to accommodate this level of detail,' making the example data an explicit requirement."
What is the name or title of an item?,4,"The user story explicitly lists example items with names/titles (e.g., 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar', 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit'). The system is designed to manage these 'iconic items' and capture 'cataloguing information' for them, which inherently includes their name or title."
What is the broad category of an item?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'Type' is a piece of cataloguing information collected for each item, as shown in the 'Example Data' (e.g., 'Type: Acoustic-electric guitar', 'Type: Stage costume', 'Type: Manuscript'). The competency question 'What is the broad category of an item?' directly corresponds to this 'Type' information, which serves as a broad category. The story also mentions, '...others are more specific to their type (e.g. the brand and type of a guitar),' reinforcing the explicit requirement to capture an item's type or category."
What is the duration of each audio or video recording?,3,"The user story states that Sonia provides ""multimedia content (images, videos, audio recordings, when available)"" as part of the item details, and a key goal is the ""automatic generation of metadata"" for the museum's knowledge base. The duration of an audio or video recording is a fundamental and standard piece of metadata for such content types. While the user story does not explicitly list ""duration"" as a required metadata field, the need to capture or generate this information is strongly inferable through common sense and domain knowledge regarding the cataloging and management of multimedia assets. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement that can be inferred from the user story."
Which colours are associate to the item?,3,"The user story emphasizes capturing 'cataloguing information' and 'description' for artifacts, aiming to 'enrich the museum's knowledge base' with 'comprehensive information.' While 'colour' is not explicitly listed as a distinct attribute in the provided examples, it is a fundamental descriptive characteristic for many physical items (e.g., costumes, instruments). Domain knowledge of museum cataloguing and common sense would infer that colour is a relevant piece of information to be captured as part of an item's detailed description or general cataloguing data, especially for visually distinct items like 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit' which includes a 'lightning bolt motif'."
Was an item involved in the creative process of a work?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'Cataloguing information' includes 'Associated Works.' The provided examples for 'Associated Works,' such as 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar: Associated Works: ""Please Please Me"" album (and other early Beatles recordings)' and 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"": Associated Work: ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" song,' directly illustrate items involved in the creative process of musical works. The competency question asks whether this specific type of information (involvement in the creative process) can be determined, which is directly supported by the explicitly mentioned data to be captured. The system's goal to capture the 'history' and 'significance' of items further reinforces this, as creative involvement is a key aspect of an item's significance."
Which instrument was used by a music artist?,4,"The user story explicitly states that ""cataloguing information"" is collected for each item. The provided ""Example Data"" for ""The Gibson J-160E Guitar"" (an instrument) includes ""Associated Artists: John Lennon, George Harrison"" as part of its cataloguing information. The competency question ""Which instrument was used by a music artist?"" directly queries this type of information, which the system is explicitly required to capture and manage as demonstrated by the example data."
 Which manuscripts was written by a music artist?,4,"The user story explicitly includes 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""' as an example item, for which the 'Cataloguing information' specifies 'Type: Manuscript'. The description for this item also explicitly states it was 'by Freddie Mercury,' who is a music artist, and 'Associated Artist: Queen' is also listed. The user story mandates the system to capture 'cataloguing information,' and these specific details (item type, writer, association with a music artist) are explicitly provided as examples of data to be captured. Therefore, the competency question asks to retrieve and filter information based on data points that the user story explicitly states the system must handle and store within its knowledge base."
 What security measures do I need to display an item?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'Display Requirements' are captured for each item when Liz adds it to the knowledge base. The 'Example Data' section provides concrete examples of these display requirements, which include specific 'Security' measures for each item (e.g., 'Security: 24/7 security monitoring,' 'Security: High-level security measures, including alarms and CCTV'). The competency question 'What security measures do I need to display an item?' directly addresses this explicitly mentioned requirement."
Which item require no direct lighting exposure?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' (including lighting, as shown in examples like 'Indirect, low-level lighting' which implies no direct exposure) are collected for each item. Furthermore, the user story includes the question, 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item, ensuring its proper handling and preservation?'. The competency question directly addresses this by asking to identify items based on a specific lighting requirement ('no direct lighting exposure'), which is a crucial piece of information for ensuring their proper handling and preservation. Querying the knowledge base for items with specific care needs is a direct way to fulfill the explicitly stated requirement of using this recorded information for preservation purposes."
What is the loan start date of an item to the British Music Experience?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'loan agreement' as a key piece of information to be managed (Keywords, Scenario). Furthermore, the 'Example Data' section provides a concrete example of a 'Loan Agreement' for an item loaned to the 'British Music Experience (BME)' which includes the attribute 'Loan Start Date'. The story states the system should 'accommodate this level of detail'. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story."
Find items in good condition,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'condition reporting' as a keyword in the Goal and includes the question, 'How will the system facilitate the creation of condition reports...?'. The example data explicitly lists 'Condition' as an attribute with 'good' as a possible value (e.g., 'General condition: Excellent (or fair, good, etc.)'). The competency question 'Find items in good condition' directly addresses a capability required to facilitate such condition reporting, as identifying items based on their specific condition (like 'good') is a fundamental aspect of generating meaningful condition reports. Therefore, the CQ addresses a requirement that is explicitly expressed through the need for condition reporting and the defined data structure for condition."
Find items with a (specific) loan start date?,3,"The user story explicitly states that 'Loan Agreement' information, including 'Loan Start Date' (as shown in example data), is captured by the system. It also states that Sonia (donor) can 'maintain an ongoing overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements.' The competency question 'Find items with a (specific) loan start date?' directly supports this overview capability. While the specific search/filter functionality by loan start date isn't verbatim in the user story, it is a standard and common-sense inference for a system that manages dated agreements and aims to provide an overview of them. Thus, it's inferred using common sense and domain knowledge."
Which are the display requirements of an item? ,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'display requirements' multiple times. Firstly, in the scenario description, it states: 'When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: cataloguing information, provenance, condition, display requirements, loan agreements, etc.' Secondly, the 'Example Data' section provides detailed 'Display Requirements' for each example item. Thirdly, one of the concluding 'Questions' in the user story is: 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item, ensuring its proper handling and preservation?' The competency question directly addresses this explicitly stated need."
How many costumes are in the collection?,3,"The user story describes a system for creating a knowledge base of loaned items, including their 'cataloguing information'. The example data explicitly includes an item with 'Type: Stage costume'. A fundamental capability of a knowledge base that stores item types is to allow querying for counts of items by type. Therefore, the competency question 'How many costumes are in the collection?' addresses a requirement that can be inferred using common sense and domain knowledge about museum knowledge bases and collection management systems. It's a basic query that utilizes the cataloged information for understanding the collection's composition, which aligns with the goal of enriching the museum's knowledge base."
How many items are in the collection?,3,"The user story states that Sonia will have an 'ongoing overview of her loaned items' via a dashboard. Common sense and typical dashboard/collection management functionalities suggest that knowing the total number of items is a fundamental part of such an overview. It is also a basic query for a system designed to 'track' and manage a 'collection' of items, as described for Liz's use when she 'systematically add[s] each item to the knowledge base'. Therefore, the capability to determine 'how many items are in the collection' is inferable from the user story using common sense and domain knowledge."
Which guitar was used by John Lennon?,4,"The user story, through its ""Example Data"" section, explicitly states that ""Associated Artists"" (e.g., ""John Lennon"" for ""The Gibson J-160E Guitar"") is a piece of ""Cataloguing information"" that the system needs to capture and manage. The competency question ""Which guitar was used by John Lennon?"" directly tests the system's ability to retrieve an item based on this explicitly defined data attribute. The user story's goal to ""enrich the museum's knowledge base"" further implies that such stored information should be accessible and queryable. Therefore, the ability to answer this question is a requirement directly and explicitly supported by the user story's specifications for data capture and its intended function as a knowledge base."
Which manuscripts require no direct lighting exposure?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are collected for each item (e.g., 'When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... display requirements'). Furthermore, the example data for 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""' (a manuscript) specifies 'Lighting: Low-level, indirect lighting.' The competency question 'Which manuscripts require no direct lighting exposure?' directly asks to retrieve items based on this type of recorded information. 'No direct lighting exposure' is a direct interpretation or a very close synonym of 'indirect lighting.' The user story also includes the question, 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item, ensuring its proper handling and preservation?', implying that this recorded information must be usable for such purposes, which includes querying. Therefore, the CQ addresses a requirement explicitly covered by the user story's scope and examples."
Who acquired an item?,4,The user story explicitly states that 'provenance' information is collected when adding an item. The provided example data for each item under the 'Provenance' section includes details like 'Acquired by Sonia: (Date and method of acquisition)'. The competency question 'Who acquired an item?' directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement to capture who acquired the item as part of its provenance.
Who acquired the Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'provenance' information is collected for each item when it's added to the knowledge base. The example data provided for 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit' (the specific item mentioned in the competency question) includes a 'Provenance' section with fields like 'Originally owned by: David Bowie' and 'Acquired by Sonia: (Date and method of acquisition)'. These pieces of information directly answer the competency question 'Who acquired the Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit?'. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement that is explicitly expressed in the user story."
Who acquired the Gibson J-160E?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'provenance' information is collected for artifacts. The provided 'Example Data' for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' includes specific fields under 'Provenance' such as 'Originally purchased by: (Original owner, if known)' and 'Acquired by Sonia: (Date and method of acquisition)'. The competency question 'Who acquired the Gibson J-160E?' directly addresses the need to retrieve this explicitly mentioned provenance information."
Does an insurer provide insurance for an item?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'Loan Agreement' information is collected, and the 'Example Data' section provides concrete examples of loan agreements. All three examples under 'Loan Agreement' include a specific entry for 'Insurance' (e.g., 'Insurance: BME to provide insurance for the full value of the guitar,' 'Insurance: V&A to provide insurance...', 'Insurance: Covered by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's permanent collection insurance.'). The competency question 'Does an insurer provide insurance for an item?' directly addresses this explicitly mentioned 'Insurance' aspect of the loan agreement. The system is required to capture this level of detail about insurance, which would enable answering whether an insurer is involved."
What is the name of an experiment step?,1,"The user story focuses on documenting and managing museum artifacts, including their cataloguing information, provenance, condition, display requirements, and loan agreements. The concept of an 'experiment step' and its name is not mentioned, nor can it be inferred from the described goals of knowledge exchange, metadata generation for artifacts, or the specific data examples provided. It appears to be an additional requirement outside the scope of the user story."
Does the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame provide insurance for the handwritten lyrics?,4,"The user story's 'Example Data' section for 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""' explicitly states under 'Loan Agreement' that the 'Borrower: Rock & Roll Hall of Fame' and 'Insurance: Covered by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's permanent collection insurance.' The competency question directly asks about this specific piece of information, which is explicitly provided as an example of data the system should handle."
Does the British Music Experience provide insurance for the Gibson J-160E?,4,"The user story, within its 'Example Data' section for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar,' explicitly states under 'Loan Agreement' that 'Insurance: BME to provide insurance for the full value of the guitar.' The competency question directly asks about this specific piece of information, which is an example of data the system must handle."
How many years does the loan agreement cover the Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit?,4,"The user story explicitly states that ""loan agreements"" are captured as part of the artifact documentation (Goal, Scenario: ""When adding a new item... various information... is collected, including: ... loan agreements""). The example data provided for loan agreements includes ""Loan Start Date"" and ""Loan End Date,"" and for one item (the Gibson J-160E Guitar), it explicitly mentions the duration in years (e.g., ""Loan End Date: 2027-12-03 (3 years)""). The competency question asks for this specific piece of information (duration in years) for an item (the Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit, which has ""Loan End Date: Indefinite (or specific date...)""), which the system is explicitly designed to store and manage as part of the loan agreement details. Therefore, the ability to determine the loan duration in years is an explicitly expressed requirement."
How many years does the loan agreement cover an item?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'loan agreements' as part of the information to be captured. The 'Example Data' section, which details the information to be managed, provides a concrete example for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' under 'Loan Agreement' that includes 'Loan Start Date: 2024-12-03' and 'Loan End Date: 2027-12-03 (3 years)'. The parenthetical '(3 years)' directly addresses the competency question about the duration of the loan agreement in years. Therefore, the requirement is explicitly expressed in the user story."
Find manuscripts associated with a music artist,4,"The user story, through its ""Example Data"" (specifically Example 3: ""Handwritten Lyrics for 'Bohemian Rhapsody'""), explicitly states that the system will capture and manage items of ""Type: Manuscript"" and their ""Associated Artist"" (e.g., ""Queen""). The story further specifies that ""The new system should be able to ... provide a clear, organised way to track and communicate this information."" The competency question ""Find manuscripts associated with a music artist"" directly addresses this explicit requirement by describing a fundamental way to access and thereby ""communicate"" this specific, explicitly mentioned information (manuscripts and their associated artists) from the knowledge base. The ""find"" operation is a direct method to fulfill the requirement of communicating the documented details."
Find an item associated with a music artist,4,"The user story explicitly states, through its 'Example Data' section, that 'Associated Artists' (e.g., 'Associated Artists: John Lennon, George Harrison' for the Gibson guitar) is a key piece of 'Cataloguing information' that is captured for each music memorabilia item. The system is designed to be a 'knowledge base' to store and manage this information. The ability to 'Find an item associated with a music artist' is a fundamental query capability required for such a knowledge base to be functional and to fulfill the goal of enriching this knowledge base with detailed metadata. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement that is explicitly supported by the data attributes and system type defined in the user story."
Find stage costumes associated with David Bowie.,3,"The user story explicitly details that cataloguing information, including ""Type"" (with ""Stage costume"" as an example) and ""Associated Artist"" (with ""David Bowie"" as an example), will be captured and stored in the museum's knowledge base (as shown in Example Data 2). While the user story does not contain an explicit statement that the system must allow searching by these specific criteria, the ability to query a knowledge base by its stored attributes is a fundamental requirement that can be readily inferred using common sense and domain knowledge about information systems and museum collections. Such a search capability is essential for the described ""knowledge exchange"" and for the ""knowledge base"" to be useful."
Do the display requirements have stable values of temperature and humidity?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are collected for artifacts. The 'Example Data' section, which is part of the user story, provides concrete examples where 'stable temperature and humidity' (for lyrics), 'climate-controlled environment with humidity control' (for a jumpsuit), and 'climate-controlled display case' (for a guitar) are listed under 'Display Requirements'. The competency question directly addresses whether display requirements include stable values for temperature and humidity, a detail explicitly shown and therefore required by the user story. Additionally, one of the questions at the end of the user story asks, 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item...?', further emphasizing the need to capture such details."
Do the display requirements have climate-controlled values of humidity control?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are collected for each item. The 'Example Data' section, which illustrates the 'level of detail' the system must accommodate, provides explicit examples of display requirements involving humidity control: for David Bowie's Jumpsuit, 'Environment: Climate-controlled environment with humidity control,' and for Handwritten Lyrics, 'Environment: Stable temperature and humidity.' The competency question asks if the system can capture 'climate-controlled values of humidity control' as part of display requirements. This is explicitly supported by the examples, as 'humidity control' and 'stable humidity' imply specific conditions or values. The user story also includes the question, 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item, ensuring its proper handling and preservation?', reinforcing the need to capture such specific environmental parameters."
Do the display requirements have climate-controlled values of lighting?,3,"The user story explicitly lists ""Display Requirements"" and provides examples such as ""Lighting: Low-level, UV-filtered lighting"" and ""Environment: Climate-controlled environment"". The competency question asks if these display requirements include ""climate-controlled values of lighting"". While specific lighting parameters (""low-level"", ""UV-filtered"") are explicitly mentioned as data to be captured under display requirements, the interpretation that these specific lighting parameters are ""climate-controlled values"" relies on domain knowledge. In museum contexts, controlling light levels and UV content is a form of environmental control for preservation, which aligns with the concept of ""climate control"". The user story also mentions that display requirements ensure ""proper handling and preservation"", supporting this inference. However, the direct assertion that *lighting values* are ""climate-controlled"" is not explicitly stated in the user story, making it an inferred requirement rather than an explicitly expressed one."
Do the display requirements have specific values of lighting?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are collected when adding a new item. Furthermore, the 'Example Data' section provides concrete examples of display requirements for artifacts, which include specific values for 'Lighting' (e.g., 'Low-level, UV-filtered lighting' for the Gibson J-160E Guitar, 'Indirect, low-level lighting' for David Bowie's jumpsuit). Therefore, the competency question directly addresses a requirement explicitly expressed and exemplified in the user story."
Do the display requirements have specific values of humidity control?,4,"The user story explicitly states that ""display requirements"" are to be recorded for artifacts (e.g., in the scenario: ""When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... display requirements...""). The provided ""Example Data"" section further clarifies this by explicitly listing ""Environment: Climate-controlled environment with humidity control"" (for David Bowie's Jumpsuit) and ""Environment: Stable temperature and humidity"" (for Handwritten Lyrics) as examples under ""Display Requirements."" The competency question, ""Do the display requirements have specific values of humidity control?"", directly addresses the necessary detail (i.e., specific values) for these explicitly mentioned aspects of display requirements. For the system to fulfill the related goal of ""ensuring its proper handling and preservation"" (mentioned in the Questions section of the user story), capturing specific values for humidity control is an inherent part of meaningfully recording ""humidity control"" or ""stable humidity."""
Which museum borrowed an item on loan?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'loan agreements' are captured as part of the information for an item. The 'Example Data' section, which is an integral part of the user story, provides concrete examples of loan agreements. Each of these examples includes a 'Borrower' field that specifies the museum that borrowed the item (e.g., 'Borrower: British Music Experience (BME)', 'Borrower: Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A)', 'Borrower: Rock & Roll Hall of Fame'). The competency question 'Which museum borrowed an item on loan?' directly asks for this explicitly mentioned and exemplified piece of information."
Which museum borrowed the Gibson J-160E on loan?,4,"The user story explicitly states that the system will capture 'loan agreements' (Scenario). The provided 'Example Data' for the 'Gibson J-160E' under 'Loan Agreement' includes the field 'Borrower: British Music Experience (BME)'. The competency question directly asks for this specific piece of information, which the system is explicitly designed to store. Furthermore, one of the 'Questions' in the user story is 'How will the system track the movement of loaned items between different museums and exhibitions...', which directly implies the system must know which museum has borrowed an item."
 Which are the associated events of the Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'cataloguing information' is collected for items. The 'Example Data' provided within the user story for 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit' specifically includes 'Associated Event: Ziggy Stardust tour (year)' as part of its cataloguing information. The competency question directly asks to retrieve this specific piece of information, which the system, as described by the user story and its examples, is required to store and make accessible."
 Which are the associated events of an item?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'Associated Event' as part of the cataloguing information for an item in the 'Example Data' section (specifically for 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit': 'Associated Event: Ziggy Stardust tour (year)'). Therefore, the competency question directly addresses a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story."
Which are the associated works of the Gibson J-160E?,4,"The user story, in its 'Example Data' section for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar', explicitly lists 'Associated Works' (e.g., '""Please Please Me"" album') as a piece of 'Cataloguing information' to be captured. The competency question 'Which are the associated works of the Gibson J-160E?' directly asks to retrieve this specific, explicitly mentioned data point, thus addressing a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story."
Which are the associated works of an item?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'Associated Works' as part of the 'Cataloguing information' in the 'Example Data' for items like 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' (e.g., '""Please Please Me"" album') and 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""' (e.g., '""Bohemian Rhapsody"" song'). The competency question directly asks for this information, which the system is designed to capture as part of an item's metadata."
Where do I display the Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit?,4,"The user story explicitly states a requirement for the system to 'track the movement of loaned items between different museums and exhibitions'. To fulfill this tracking requirement, the system must store and manage information about the current or assigned location (e.g., specific museum, gallery, or exhibition) of artifacts like the Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit. The competency question 'Where do I display the Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit?' directly asks for this location information, which is essential data for the explicitly mentioned tracking functionality. Additionally, 'display requirements' are explicitly mentioned as information to be captured, which can also inform where an item is suitable to be displayed."
Where do I display an item?,4,"The user story explicitly states that ""display requirements"" are collected for each item (e.g., ""When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... display requirements""). The example data also details ""Display Requirements"" for each item, such as ""Display case: Secure, climate-controlled display case."" The competency question ""Where do I display an item?"" directly asks for this information, which the system is designed to capture and manage as part of the artifact's documentation."
What an item has the serial number (Unique identifier)?,4,"The user story, within the 'Example Data' section for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar', explicitly lists 'Serial Number: (Unique identifier)' as a component of 'Cataloguing information'. The competency question 'What an item has the serial number (Unique identifier)?' directly addresses the need to know this specific piece of information, which is explicitly stated as data to be captured by the system."
What items from Sonia’s collection are currently on loan to the British Music Experience (BME)?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'Sonia is granted (limited) access to the dashboard. This empowers her to maintain an ongoing overview of her loaned items...'. The competency question, 'What items from Sonia’s collection are currently on loan to the British Music Experience (BME)?', directly addresses a fundamental aspect of this 'overview' functionality. Given that the user story's primary goal is Sonia loaning items to the BME, this specific query is a core part of the explicitly stated overview requirement. Furthermore, the 'Questions' section within the user story asks, 'How will the system track the movement of loaned items between different museums and exhibitions...', which implies that the system is expected to know the location of loaned items, thus directly supporting the capability to answer the competency question."
"What is the complete provenance history of a given item, including previous owners, acquisition dates, and prior loans to other institutions?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'provenance' is a key piece of information to be collected when adding an item to the knowledge base. The provided 'Example Data' further details what constitutes provenance for an item like 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar', including 'Originally purchased by: (Original owner, if known)', 'Acquired by Sonia: (Date and method of acquisition)', and 'Previous loans: (List of museums and dates)'. These examples directly align with the components of the competency question ('previous owners', 'acquisition dates', 'prior loans to other institutions'), indicating that the CQ addresses requirements explicitly expressed and exemplified in the user story."
"Which items in the museum’s collection are on temporary loan, and what are their respective loan start and end dates?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'Loan Start Date' and 'Loan End Date' are captured as part of the 'Loan Agreement' for loaned items (as shown in the Example Data: e.g., Gibson J-160E Guitar has specific start/end dates). Sonia, a key persona, needs 'to maintain an ongoing overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements.' Identifying which items are on temporary loan (i.e., have a defined end date, distinguishing them from 'indefinite loan' or 'full donation' also mentioned) and knowing these specific dates is fundamental to understanding the status of these agreements and managing them. The keyword 'temporary exhibition' further supports the need to manage items on temporary loan. Therefore, the competency question directly addresses requirements for data capture (start/end dates) and data access (status of loan agreements) that are explicitly expressed in the user story."
"What is the current status of the loan agreement for a specific item (e.g., active, expired, indefinite, donated)?",4,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia, the donor, will have access to the dashboard to 'maintain an ongoing overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements'. The competency question 'What is the current status of the loan agreement for a specific item (e.g., active, expired, indefinite, donated)?' directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement. The example statuses in the CQ (active, expired, indefinite, donated) are also consistent with the types of loan agreements described in the 'Example Data' section of the user story (e.g., specific end dates implying active/expired, 'indefinite loan', 'full donation')."
"Which institutions have previously borrowed a specific item, and during which periods?",4,"The user story, specifically within the 'Example Data' section for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar,' explicitly lists 'Previous loans: (List of museums and dates)' as a sub-field under 'Provenance.' The competency question 'Which institutions have previously borrowed a specific item, and during which periods?' directly queries this exact information. The scenario also states that 'provenance' is among the information collected for an artifact."
"What cataloguing information is available for a given item (e.g., type, brand, model, serial number, associated artists, associated works)?",4,"The user story explicitly states in the scenario that ""When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: cataloguing information..."". Furthermore, the ""Example Data"" section provides detailed examples of ""Cataloguing information"" for items like ""The Gibson J-160E Guitar,"" which include ""Type,"" ""Brand,"" ""Model,"" ""Serial Number,"" ""Associated Artists,"" and ""Associated Works."" These are the exact types of information queried by the competency question, making the CQ directly address an explicitly expressed requirement."
"What multimedia content (images, videos, audio recordings) is associated with a specific item, and how can it be accessed?",4,"The user story explicitly states in the 'Scenario' section that Sonia 'meticulously compiles the details of these items, including their ... multimedia content (images, videos, audio recordings, when available)'. It also mentions that Liz 'diligently ensures that all the details provided by Sonia are accurately captured within the system.' Furthermore, one of the 'Questions' at the end of the user story asks, 'How will the system facilitate the creation of condition reports, including the ability to upload photographs...?'. The competency question directly addresses the requirement to know what multimedia content is associated with an item (as provided by Sonia and captured by the system) and how this content can be accessed (which is essential for its use, e.g., in condition reports or general knowledge base enrichment, both explicit goals of the system)."
"What is the historical and cultural significance of a given item, as described by the donor or curator?",4,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia (donor) provides details including the 'history' and 'significance' of the items. Furthermore, one of the questions in the user story is 'How will the system capture and store the complex history and significance of iconic items...?'. The competency question directly asks about this 'historical and cultural significance' as described by the donor or curator, which is a requirement explicitly expressed."
"What metadata fields are mandatory for each type of item (e.g., instrument, costume, manuscript), and which are optional or type-specific?",3,"The user story explicitly states, 'Some of these attributes apply to every item; while others are more specific to their type.' This directly supports the 'type-specific' aspect of the competency question. The need to determine which fields are 'mandatory' or 'optional' for each item type is a strong and logical inference based on the goals of 'efficient knowledge transfer,' 'automatic generation of metadata,' and ensuring Liz 'diligently ensures that all the details provided by Sonia are accurately captured.' While the terms 'mandatory' and 'optional' are not used verbatim, defining these constraints is essential for implementing a robust metadata system as described and can be inferred using common sense and domain knowledge in system design and metadata management."
"What is the current condition of a specific item, including any documented damage or conservation treatments?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'current condition' is part of the information Sonia provides for her items and that 'condition' is one of the attributes collected when an item is added to the knowledge base. The 'Example Data' section further details this by including 'Condition' with sub-fields like 'General condition', 'Description of any damage', and 'Conservation history', which directly map to the components ('current condition', 'documented damage', 'conservation treatments') of the competency question. The 'Questions' section also reinforces this by asking how the system will facilitate 'condition reports'."
Are there annotated photographs or reports highlighting specific areas of concern or interest on an item?,4,"The user story, in its ""Questions"" section, explicitly asks: ""How will the system facilitate the creation of condition reports, including the ability to upload photographs and annotate specific areas of an item?"". The competency question ""Are there annotated photographs or reports highlighting specific areas of concern or interest on an item?"" directly addresses the existence and retrievability of these specific types of information (annotated photographs and reports detailing concerns), which the system is explicitly required to support based on the user story."
"What is the conservation history of an item, including dates and types of treatments performed?",4,"The user story, within its ""Example Data"" section, explicitly lists ""Conservation history"" as a component of an item's ""Condition"" information. The examples provided (e.g., ""Refretted in (year), cleaned and polished in (year)"" for the Gibson J-160E Guitar; ""Textile conservation treatment in (year)"" for David Bowie's Jumpsuit) directly correspond to the competency question's request for ""dates and types of treatments performed."" The user story further states that the system should be able to ""accommodate this level of detail,"" making the CQ's requirement explicitly expressed."
"What are the display requirements for a specific item (e.g., case type, lighting, environmental controls)?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are part of the information collected when adding an item to the knowledge base ('When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... display requirements...'). The 'Example Data' section further details these requirements for specific items (e.g., 'Display case: Secure, climate-controlled display case,' 'Lighting: Low-level, UV-filtered lighting,' 'Environment: Climate-controlled environment with humidity control'), directly aligning with the CQ. Additionally, one of the questions at the end of the user story is 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item...?', which directly addresses the competency question."
What handling and security instructions are associated with an item while on display or in storage?,4,"The user story explicitly states that ""display requirements"" are collected for each item. The provided ""Example Data"" for ""Display Requirements"" includes specific ""Handling"" instructions (e.g., ""White gloves are required for handling"") and ""Security"" instructions (e.g., ""24/7 security monitoring,"" ""High-level security measures""). Furthermore, one of the ""Questions"" at the end of the user story is: ""Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item, ensuring its proper handling and preservation?"", which directly addresses the need to capture handling and security related instructions."
"Which items require special display equipment (e.g., custom mannequins, acid-free matting) or environmental conditions?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are collected for each item. The 'Example Data' section provides specific examples of such requirements, including 'custom-fit mannequin' and 'acid-free matting,' which are directly mentioned in the competency question. Furthermore, one of the questions at the end of the user story is 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item...?', directly aligning with the CQ's focus on identifying items with special display needs."
"What items loaned by Sonia are currently visible to her via the dashboard, and what information can she access or update?",4,"The user story explicitly states: 'Sonia is granted (limited) access to the dashboard. This empowers her to maintain an ongoing overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements...' It also mentions the system 'enabling Sonia to directly contribute to the museum's knowledge base'. The competency question directly addresses these points by asking: 1. 'What items loaned by Sonia are currently visible to her via the dashboard' (aligns with 'ongoing overview of her loaned items'). 2. 'what information can she access' (aligns with 'overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements'). 3. 'or update?' (aligns with defining the scope of 'limited access' and the mechanism for her to 'directly contribute to the museum's knowledge base'). Thus, the CQ seeks to detail requirements explicitly expressed in the user story."
What is the communication history between Sonia and the museum regarding a specific item or loan agreement?,3,"The user story aims for a system that ensures 'efficient knowledge transfer,' 'transparency,' and 'facilitating clear communication' regarding loaned items and 'loan agreements.' While not explicitly stating that a full 'communication history' (like all email threads or call logs) must be stored, the ability to retrieve a history of significant events, changes, and decisions concerning a specific item or loan agreement (e.g., versions of a loan agreement, logs of status changes, system-recorded approvals or notifications) is strongly inferable. Such a history is crucial for maintaining clarity, resolving potential disputes, and understanding the evolution of an agreement, directly supporting the stated goals of transparency and clear communication. Common sense and domain knowledge in managing collaborative processes and agreements suggest that recording this type of history is a key component. The user story also mentions the system should 'track' information, which for agreements would naturally include their history or evolution."
"What changes or updates have been made to the metadata or status of a loaned item, and by whom?",3,"The user story explicitly mentions the need for an 'audit trail' for the movement of items (which implies tracking changes and who made them for location/status) and for the donor (Sonia) to have an 'ongoing overview of ... status of loan agreements' (implying visibility of updates to this status). The competency question 'What changes or updates have been made to the metadata or status of a loaned item, and by whom?' generalizes these aspects. While not every part of this general question (e.g., tracking 'by whom' for *all* metadata changes) is explicitly stated for all types of metadata, the requirement to track changes and their origin is strongly inferable from the stated goals of 'transparency,' 'accurate documentation,' 'knowledge exchange,' the example of 'Conservation history' (which is a log of changes/updates), and the specific tracking examples provided. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement that can be inferred from the user story using common sense and domain knowledge."
"In which exhibitions or display cases has a specific item been featured, and during what time periods?",4,"The user story explicitly states requirements that directly address the competency question. Specifically: 1. The 'Example Data' for 'Provenance' includes 'Previous loans: (List of museums and dates),' which directly supports knowing in which institutions (often for exhibitions) an item has been featured and the corresponding time periods. 2. A question within the user story asks, 'How will the system track the movement of loaned items between different museums and exhibitions, providing a clear audit trail?' This explicitly requires the system to record information about exhibitions and their timing. 3. The keyword 'temporary exhibition' is also mentioned. These elements directly cover the CQ's need to identify exhibitions and time periods. The 'display cases' aspect of the CQ, while less direct, is related to 'Display Requirements' (which mention display cases) and would be a natural detail within a comprehensive audit trail or enriched knowledge base about an exhibition, aligning with the user story's goals."
"What is the current physical location of a specific item (e.g., on display, in storage, in transit)?",4,"The user story explicitly includes the question: ""How will the system track the movement of loaned items between different museums and exhibitions, providing a clear audit trail?"". The competency question ""What is the current physical location of a specific item (e.g., on display, in storage, in transit)?"" directly addresses a core aspect of this requirement. To track movement and provide an audit trail, the system must be able to report the item's current location or status, such as being on display, in storage, or in transit, which are the examples provided in the CQ."
"What is the audit trail of an item’s movement between museums, exhibitions, and storage locations?",4,"The user story, within its 'Questions' section, explicitly asks: 'How will the system track the movement of loaned items between different museums and exhibitions, providing a clear audit trail?'. This question directly mirrors the competency question, indicating that the CQ addresses a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story."
"What are the terms of the loan agreement for a specific item (e.g., compensation, insurance, transport arrangements)?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'loan agreements' are a key piece of information captured by the system. The 'Scenario' mentions Sonia providing 'proposed loan terms' and Liz adding 'loan agreements' to the knowledge base. Furthermore, the 'Example Data' section provides concrete examples of loan agreement terms for multiple items, specifically listing 'Compensation', 'Insurance', and 'Transport' under the 'Loan Agreement' heading. The competency question directly asks for these explicitly mentioned terms of a loan agreement for a specific item."
"Who is responsible for insurance and transport of a loaned item, and what are the coverage details?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'loan agreements' are part of the information collected for an artifact. The 'Example Data' section further details that 'Loan Agreement' information includes who is responsible for insurance (e.g., 'BME to provide insurance'), insurance coverage details (e.g., 'for the full value of the guitar'), and who is responsible for transport (e.g., 'BME to arrange and cover the cost'). The competency question directly asks for these explicitly mentioned details."
"What compensation or benefits (e.g., tax deduction, annual fee) are associated with a specific loan or donation?",4,"The user story explicitly mentions that 'loan agreements' are part of the information collected for each item. The 'Example Data' section further clarifies this by providing concrete examples of 'Loan Agreement' details, which include a 'Compensation' field. This field lists examples such as '£5,000 per year' (an annual fee) and 'Tax deduction for the appraised value', directly addressing the types of compensation and benefits mentioned in the competency question. Therefore, the CQ addresses a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story."
"How does the addition of a new item from Sonia’s collection enrich the museum’s knowledge base (e.g., new artists, works, or historical periods represented)?",4,"The user story explicitly states a core goal: 'automatic generation of metadata to enrich the museum's knowledge base.' The competency question directly investigates this explicit goal by asking 'How does the addition of a new item from Sonia’s collection enrich the museum’s knowledge base...?' The examples provided in the CQ (e.g., 'new artists, works') align directly with the 'Cataloguing information' (which includes 'Associated Artists' and 'Associated Works') that the user story specifies will be collected for each item. Therefore, the CQ addresses a requirement—understanding the nature and specifics of the knowledge base enrichment—that is explicitly expressed in the user story's goal and supported by its detailed data examples."
What gaps or overlaps exist in the museum’s collection after integrating Sonia’s loaned items?,2,"The user story S1 describes a system focused on facilitating the loan process for Sonia's items, including data capture, metadata generation, and providing Sonia with an overview of her loaned items. This system feeds data into the broader ""museum’s knowledge systems."" The competency question, ""What gaps or overlaps exist in the museum’s collection after integrating Sonia’s loaned items?"", pertains to an analytical capability for the entire museum collection. While this analysis is crucial for understanding the impact of new acquisitions and strategically ""enriching the museum's knowledge base"" (a goal of S1), the user story does not specify that the ""new system"" for loan facilitation will itself perform this collection-wide gap/overlap analysis. Such analysis is typically a broader curatorial or collection management function. Therefore, the CQ is not a directly inferable requirement for the specific system detailed in S1. However, the system described in S1, by successfully integrating Sonia's items and their detailed metadata, acts as a critical enabler for this type of analysis to be performed (likely using the broader knowledge systems), thereby supporting the overall strategic goals related to the collection's enrichment."
"What are the different types of artifacts in the collection (e.g., Instrument, Stage Costume, Manuscript)?",4,"The user story explicitly lists 'Type' as a key piece of cataloguing information for each artifact, providing examples such as 'Acoustic-electric guitar', 'Stage costume', and 'Manuscript'. It also states that some attributes are 'more specific to their type'. The competency question directly asks for these different types of artifacts, which is a requirement explicitly expressed and exemplified in the user story."
"What specific attributes are relevant for an Instrument (e.g., Brand, Model, Serial Number, Type: Acoustic-electric)?",4,"The user story explicitly states that when adding a new item, 'various information of the artefact is collected, including: cataloguing information... Some of these attributes apply to every item; while others are more specific to their type (e.g. the brand and type of a guitar).' The competency question asks for 'specific attributes ... relevant for an Instrument (e.g., Brand, Model, Serial Number, Type: Acoustic-electric)'. The 'Example Data' section for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' (an instrument) explicitly lists these attributes: 'Type: Acoustic-electric guitar', 'Brand: Gibson', 'Model: J-160E', 'Serial Number'. Therefore, the CQ addresses a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story."
"What specific attributes are relevant for a Stage Costume (e.g., Designer, Description)?",4,The user story explicitly states that 'Some of these attributes apply to every item; while others are more specific to their type'. The 'Example Data' section then provides a specific example of a 'Stage costume' (David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit) and explicitly lists 'Designer' and 'Description' as its cataloguing attributes. This directly addresses the competency question by demonstrating the relevance of these specific attributes for a stage costume.
"What specific attributes are relevant for a Manuscript (e.g., Description, Medium: Handwritten)?",4,"The user story explicitly mentions the need to capture type-specific attributes for artifacts ('Some of these attributes apply to every item; while others are more specific to their type'). It then provides 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""' as an example item, explicitly categorizing its 'Type' as 'Manuscript' and listing 'Description' (e.g., 'Handwritten lyrics...') as part of its 'Cataloguing information'. The competency question directly asks to identify these specific attributes for a Manuscript, using 'Description' and 'Medium: Handwritten' as examples, which aligns directly with the explicit information and requirements presented in the user story."
"Which Artist(s) are associated with a specific artifact (e.g., Gibson J-160E -> John Lennon, George Harrison)?",4,"The user story explicitly mentions that 'cataloguing information' is collected for each artifact. The 'Example Data' section, which illustrates the type of information to be captured, provides specific examples under 'Cataloguing information' that include 'Associated Artists' for artifacts like 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' (John Lennon, George Harrison), 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit' (David Bowie), and 'Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""' (Queen). The competency question directly queries this explicitly mentioned data point."
"Which Work(s) (e.g., album, song) are associated with a specific artifact (e.g., Gibson J-160E -> ""Please Please Me"" album; Handwritten Lyrics -> ""Bohemian Rhapsody"")?",4,"The user story explicitly details, through its 'Example Data' section, that 'Associated Works' (e.g., albums, songs) are part of the 'Cataloguing information' to be captured for artifacts. The competency question directly asks for this information, and the examples provided in the CQ (Gibson J-160E -> ""Please Please Me"" album; Handwritten Lyrics -> ""Bohemian Rhapsody"") are directly reflected in the user story's example data."
"Which Event(s) (e.g., tour, recording session) are associated with a specific artifact (e.g., Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit -> Ziggy Stardust tour)?",4,"The user story's ""Example Data"" section explicitly lists ""Associated Event: Ziggy Stardust tour (year)"" as part of the cataloguing information for ""David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit."" This directly addresses the competency question, which asks to identify events associated with a specific artifact, using the same example. Therefore, the competency question addresses a requirement that is explicitly expressed in the user story."
"What is the unique identifier (e.g., catalog number, serial number if applicable) for a given artifact?",4,"The user story's ""Example Data"" section explicitly lists ""Serial Number: (Unique identifier)"" as part of the ""Cataloguing information"" for ""The Gibson J-160E Guitar."" The scenario also states that ""cataloguing information"" is collected when adding a new item. The competency question directly asks for this unique identifier, which the system is expected to manage as per the user story's details."
"How can we retrieve all artifacts associated with a specific Artist (e.g., David Bowie)?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'Associated Artist' is a piece of cataloguing information captured for artifacts (e.g., 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit: Associated Artist: David Bowie'). The system's goal is to create a 'knowledge base' and 'provide a clear, organised way to track and communicate this information.' Retrieving all artifacts associated with a specific artist is a direct and fundamental way to access and utilize this explicitly mentioned data within such a system, fulfilling the need to track and communicate information stored in the knowledge base."
"How can we retrieve all artifacts classified as a specific Type (e.g., Stage Costume)?",3,"The user story explicitly states that 'Type' is a key piece of cataloguing information for artifacts (e.g., 'Type: Stage costume,' 'Type: Acoustic-electric guitar') and that these details are added to the museum's 'knowledge base.' While the user story does not contain a sentence explicitly stating 'the system must allow retrieval of artifacts by type,' this capability is a fundamental and directly inferable requirement for any useful knowledge base that categorizes items by type. Common sense and domain knowledge dictate that if items are classified by type, users will need to retrieve them based on this classification for managing, viewing, or analyzing the collection."
Who was the original owner of a specific artifact (if known)?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'provenance' as a key piece of information to be collected when adding an item to the knowledge base. The 'Example Data' section further details this by including fields such as 'Originally purchased by: (Original owner, if known)' and 'Originally owned by: David Bowie' under the 'Provenance' heading for artifacts. The competency question 'Who was the original owner of a specific artifact (if known)?' directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement."
"Who is the current owner of a specific artifact (e.g., Sonia)?",4,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia is loaning items ""from her collection,"" establishing her as the owner of these items. The system's goal is to facilitate this loan process for Sonia. Furthermore, ""provenance"" is listed as information to be collected, and the example provenance data includes details like ""Acquired by Sonia,"" which directly addresses and records the current ownership of the artifacts Sonia is loaning. Therefore, the need to identify the current owner (Sonia, in the context of the user story) is an explicitly expressed requirement for the system."
"How and when did the current owner (e.g., Sonia) acquire a specific artifact?",4,"The user story, particularly in the 'Example Data' section, explicitly details that 'Provenance' information should be captured for each artifact. This includes the sub-field 'Acquired by Sonia: (Date and method of acquisition)', which directly addresses the competency question about how and when the current owner acquired the artifact."
Has a specific artifact been loaned out previously? To which institutions and during which dates?,4,"The user story, within the 'Example Data' section for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar', explicitly lists 'Previous loans: (List of museums and dates)' under 'Provenance'. This directly corresponds to the information requested by the competency question."
What is the complete ownership history (provenance trail) for a given artifact?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions 'provenance' multiple times as a key piece of information to be documented and collected for artifacts (Keywords section; Scenario: 'Sonia meticulously compiles the details of these items, including their history...'; Scenario: 'When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: ... provenance...'). The 'Example Data' section further details the type of provenance information, including 'Originally purchased by,' 'Acquired by Sonia,' and 'Previous loans,' which directly constitute elements of an 'ownership history' or 'provenance trail.' The competency question asks for the retrieval of this explicitly managed information, which is a direct requirement."
"What is the recorded general condition (e.g., Excellent, Fair, Good, Fragile, Delicate) of a specific artifact?",4,"The user story explicitly mentions that 'current condition' is part of the details Sonia compiles for her items (Scenario section). It also states that when Liz adds an item to the knowledge base, 'condition' is one of the pieces of information collected. Furthermore, the 'Example Data' section provides concrete examples of artifacts where 'General condition' is recorded with values like 'Excellent,' 'Fragile,' and 'Delicate,' which directly align with the competency question. The keyword 'condition reporting' is also listed."
"What specific damage (e.g., scratches, fraying, fading, creasing, foxing) is noted for a particular artifact?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'condition' information is captured for each artifact. The 'Example Data' section, which is part of the user story, further clarifies this by providing a 'Description of any damage' field under 'Condition' for each example artifact. This field includes specific damages such as 'Minor scratches on the body', 'Minor fraying at the cuffs, some fading of the fabric', and 'Some creasing and foxing of the paper'. The competency question directly asks for these types of specific damages (e.g., scratches, fraying, fading, creasing, foxing), which are explicitly mentioned as data points to be collected within the user story."
"What conservation treatments has a specific artifact undergone, and when?",4,"The user story, within its 'Example Data' section, explicitly lists 'Conservation history' as a sub-component of an artifact's 'Condition'. Examples provided, such as 'Refretted in (year), cleaned and polished in (year)' and 'Textile conservation treatment in (year)', directly address the competency question by detailing what conservation treatments an artifact has undergone and when."
How can we find all artifacts currently assessed as being in 'Fragile' or 'Delicate' condition?,4,"The user story explicitly includes 'condition reporting' as a keyword and poses a question: 'How will the system facilitate the creation of condition reports...?'. The competency question, 'How can we find all artifacts currently assessed as being in 'Fragile' or 'Delicate' condition?', directly addresses this by asking for a method to generate a specific type of condition-based list. Furthermore, the conditions 'Fragile' and 'Delicate' are explicitly provided as example values for an artifact's condition in the 'Example Data' section of the user story. Thus, the CQ seeks to fulfill an explicitly stated requirement (condition reporting) using explicitly mentioned data attributes and values."
"What are the specific display case requirements for an artifact (e.g., Secure, Climate-controlled)?",4,"The user story explicitly states in the scenario that when adding a new item, 'display requirements' are collected. Furthermore, the 'Example Data' for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' explicitly lists 'Display case: Secure, climate-controlled display case' under 'Display Requirements.' The competency question directly asks about these specific display case requirements, which the system described in the user story is intended to capture."
"What are the lighting requirements for displaying an artifact (e.g., Low-level, UV-filtered, Indirect)?",4,"The user story explicitly states that when adding a new item to the collection, 'display requirements' are collected. The 'Example Data' section provides concrete examples of lighting requirements for artifacts, such as 'Lighting: Low-level, UV-filtered lighting' for the Gibson J-160E Guitar and 'Lighting: Indirect, low-level lighting' for David Bowie's jumpsuit. Furthermore, one of the questions at the end of the user story is: 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item...?'. The competency question directly addresses this explicitly stated requirement."
"Are there specific handling instructions (e.g., White gloves required)?",4,"The competency question 'Are there specific handling instructions (e.g., White gloves required)?' directly addresses a requirement explicitly expressed in the user story. The user story's 'Example Data' for 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' under 'Display Requirements' explicitly states: 'Handling: White gloves are required for handling.' Furthermore, the 'Questions' section of the user story asks: 'Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item, ensuring its proper handling and preservation?', which encompasses specific handling instructions."
"What level of security is required for a specific artifact (e.g., 24/7 monitoring, High-level, Alarms, CCTV)?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are collected for each artifact. The 'Example Data' section further clarifies this by providing specific security details (e.g., 'Security: 24/7 security monitoring,' 'Security: High-level security measures, including alarms and CCTV') as part of the 'Display Requirements' for several artifacts. The competency question directly asks about this specific piece of information (level of security), which is therefore an explicitly expressed requirement for the system to capture."
"Does an artifact require specific environmental controls (e.g., humidity control)?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are collected for each artifact. The 'Example Data' section provides concrete examples of these display requirements, which include 'climate-controlled display case,' 'climate-controlled environment with humidity control,' and 'stable temperature and humidity.' The competency question 'Does an artifact require specific environmental controls (e.g., humidity control)?' directly addresses this explicitly stated need to capture and query information about environmental controls as part of an artifact's display requirements."
Does a costume require a custom-fit mannequin?,4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are among the information collected for an artifact. The 'Example Data' section provides an example of 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit,' which is a type of costume. For this item, under 'Display Requirements,' it is explicitly listed: 'Mannequin: Custom-fit mannequin to support the garment's structure.' Therefore, the competency question directly addresses a requirement (the system's ability to capture whether a costume needs a custom-fit mannequin) that is explicitly expressed through the examples in the user story."
"Does a manuscript require specific framing (e.g., Acid-free matting, UV-filtering glass)?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'display requirements' are captured for each item. The 'Example Data' section includes an example of a manuscript ('Handwritten Lyrics for ""Bohemian Rhapsody""') where its 'Display Requirements' explicitly list 'Framing: Acid-free matting and UV-filtering glass.' This directly addresses the competency question by showing that such specific framing details are indeed part of the requirements to be recorded for a manuscript."
"Who is the donor/lender (e.g., Sonia) for a specific loaned artifact?",4,"The user story explicitly states that 'Sonia is granted (limited) access to the dashboard. This empowers her to maintain an ongoing overview of *her loaned items*'. To fulfill this requirement, the system must be able to identify which items belong to Sonia, meaning it must know who the donor/lender is for each specific artifact. The entire user story revolves around Sonia (identified as a 'donor' in Personas and the one 'loaning' items in the Goal and Scenario) providing items, making the identity of the lender a fundamental piece of information directly necessary for the described system functionality."
"Who is the borrower (e.g., BME, V&A, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame) for a specific loan agreement?",4,"The user story explicitly mentions that 'loan agreements' are part of the information collected for an artifact. Furthermore, the 'Example Data' section provides concrete examples of 'Loan Agreement' details for several items, and each example explicitly includes a 'Borrower' field (e.g., 'Borrower: British Music Experience (BME)', 'Borrower: Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A)'). Therefore, the competency question about identifying the borrower for a specific loan agreement addresses a requirement that is explicitly expressed in the user story."
"What is the start date and end date (or status like 'Indefinite', 'Full Donation') of a specific loan agreement?",4,"The user story explicitly details the components of a 'Loan Agreement' through its 'Example Data' section. For instance, 'The Gibson J-160E Guitar' example lists 'Loan Start Date: 2024-12-03' and 'Loan End Date: 2027-12-03'. Similarly, 'David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Jumpsuit' example shows 'Loan End Date: Indefinite (or specific date, or 'full donation')'. The competency question 'What is the start date and end date (or status like 'Indefinite', 'Full Donation') of a specific loan agreement?' directly asks for these attributes which are explicitly expressed and exemplified as part of the loan agreement information to be managed by the system."
What is the agreed compensation (if any) for a specific loan?,4,"The user story, particularly in the 'Example Data' section, explicitly lists 'Compensation' as a key piece of information under 'Loan Agreement' for each example item (e.g., 'Compensation: £5,000 per year' for The Gibson J-160E Guitar). The competency question directly asks for this explicitly mentioned information."
Who is responsible for insurance under a specific loan agreement?,4,"The user story, specifically within the 'Example Data' section, explicitly details the 'Loan Agreement' information for each item. This information includes a field for 'Insurance' which specifies who is responsible (e.g., 'BME to provide insurance...', 'V&A to provide insurance...'). The competency question 'Who is responsible for insurance under a specific loan agreement?' directly asks for this explicitly stated piece of information within the loan agreement details."
Who is responsible for arranging and covering the cost of transport for a specific loan?,4,"The user story explicitly mentions that the system captures 'loan agreements'. The 'Example Data' section provides concrete examples of loan agreements, and each example includes a 'Transport' field detailing who is responsible for arranging and covering the cost of transport (e.g., 'BME to arrange and cover the cost of secure transport', 'Jointly arranged and costs shared between Sonia and the V&A'). The competency question directly asks about this specific piece of information, which is explicitly shown as data to be managed by the system."
Is a specific artifact currently on loan? To whom?,4,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia needs 'an ongoing overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements.' The competency question 'Is a specific artifact currently on loan? To whom?' directly addresses this requirement. The example data provided in the user story for 'Loan Agreement' includes 'Borrower' (answering 'To whom?') and 'Loan Start Date' / 'Loan End Date' (which determine if an artifact is 'currently on loan'). The user story also specifies that the system should 'accommodate this level of detail and provide a clear, organised way to track and communicate this information.' Thus, the ability to answer this CQ is an explicitly expressed requirement of the system."
Which artifacts loaned by Sonia are currently held by the BME?,4,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia wants to loan items to the BME and that the BME system will manage these loans, including capturing loan agreements. Sonia is granted dashboard access to 'maintain an ongoing overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements.' For this overview to be meaningful regarding her loans to the BME (the primary focus of the user story), the system must be able to identify and list which of her artifacts are currently held by the BME. The system explicitly captures 'Loan Agreement' details, including 'Borrower' (e.g., BME) and 'Loan Start Date'/'Loan End Date', which directly enables answering the competency question. Additionally, one of the 'Questions' in the user story asks, 'How will the system track the movement of loaned items between different museums and exhibitions...', which directly implies the system must know the current holder of an item, such as the BME."
"Which loan agreements are set to expire within the next [time period, e.g., 6 months]?",3,"The user story explicitly states that the system captures ""Loan End Date"" as part of ""Loan Agreements"" (evidenced in Example Data) and that users (e.g., Sonia) can ""maintain an ongoing overview of ... the status of loan agreements."" The competency question, ""Which loan agreements are set to expire within the next [time period, e.g., 6 months]?"", asks for information crucial to understanding this ""status."" While the user story does not explicitly state that the system must list loans expiring within a specific user-defined timeframe, this capability is a fundamental and common-sense inference for managing time-bound agreements and understanding their current status. This functionality is inferred from the explicit need to track ""status"" and the availability of ""Loan End Date,"" using domain knowledge about managing agreements. Therefore, the CQ addresses a requirement (providing detailed insight into loan status regarding expiration) that can be inferred from the explicitly stated requirements."
Has an artifact been designated as a 'Full Donation' rather than a loan?,4,"The user story's 'Example Data' section explicitly mentions 'full donation' as a possible value within the 'Loan Agreement' details for multiple artifacts (e.g., for The Gibson J-160E Guitar: 'Compensation: ... or ""full donation""'; for David Bowie's Jumpsuit: 'Loan End Date: ... or ""full donation""'; for Handwritten Lyrics: 'Loan End Date: Full donation'). The competency question directly asks about this specific designation, which the system must be able to capture according to the provided examples."
What are all the artifacts currently under loan agreements with the BME as the borrower?,4,"The user story's primary goal is ""Sonia wants to seamlessly loan valuable and iconic items from her collection to the BME."" The system is designed to facilitate this, with BME staff like Liz using it to add items and their ""loan agreements"" to the knowledge base. The example data for such a loan explicitly lists ""Borrower: British Music Experience (BME)"". Therefore, the competency question, which asks to identify artifacts where BME is the borrower, directly addresses a requirement for information that is explicitly stated to be captured and managed by the system as part of its core function."
How can the system represent the relationship between a donor (Sonia) and the artifacts they have loaned?,4,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia (the donor) loans items from her collection and is granted access to 'maintain an ongoing overview of *her loaned items*.' For the system to fulfill this requirement, it must explicitly represent and manage the relationship between Sonia and the artifacts she has loaned. The collection of 'loan agreements' also inherently requires defining and storing this relationship."
"How can the system represent the status of a loan (e.g., Proposed, Active, Expired, Donated)?a",4,"The user story explicitly states that Sonia should be able to 'maintain an ongoing overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements'. The competency question, 'How can the system represent the status of a loan (e.g., Proposed, Active, Expired, Donated)?', directly addresses this explicit requirement by inquiring about the representation of this loan status. The examples of statuses provided in the CQ are logical derivations from the concept of a loan agreement lifecycle, which includes start dates, end dates, and the possibility of donation, all mentioned or implied in the user story's example data."
"What information about loaned artifacts should be visible to the donor (Sonia) via the dashboard? (e.g., Loan status, Location within museum, Current condition summary?)",4,"The user story explicitly states: 'Sonia is granted (limited) access to the dashboard. This empowers her to maintain an ongoing overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements...'. The competency question, 'What information about loaned artifacts should be visible to the donor (Sonia) via the dashboard?', directly addresses the need to define the specific information content of this explicitly mentioned 'ongoing overview'. Determining what information Sonia sees on the dashboard is a direct requirement for implementing the stated feature."
How does the system distinguish between artifacts owned outright by the museum and those on loan?,4,"The user story explicitly details that the system manages 'loan agreements' (Scenario, Example Data). The 'Example Data' for 'Loan Agreement' explicitly includes 'full donation' as a possible term (e.g., for Handwritten Lyrics: 'Loan End Date: Full donation'). An item that is 'fully donated' becomes 'owned outright by the museum,' while other items remain 'on loan' under their respective agreements. Therefore, to accurately process and represent these explicitly mentioned loan agreement terms and their outcomes, the system must distinguish between these two states. The competency question directly addresses this distinction, which is a necessary capability derived from explicitly stated requirements for handling loan agreements."
"How can Liz retrieve all information (cataloguing, provenance, condition, display, loan) associated with a single artifact added via the loan process?",4,"The user story explicitly states that Liz is responsible for ensuring 'all the details provided by Sonia are accurately captured within the system.' To fulfill this responsibility, Liz must be able to retrieve and view the information that has been entered. Furthermore, the user story explicitly lists the types of information collected: 'cataloguing information, provenance, condition, display requirements, loan agreements, etc.,' which directly correspond to the information types in the competency question (cataloguing, provenance, condition, display, loan). The system is also described as a 'knowledge base' and provides 'overview' (retrieval) access to donors like Sonia, making retrieval a core and explicit function of the system. Therefore, Liz's ability to retrieve this comprehensive information for an artifact is an explicitly expressed requirement."
