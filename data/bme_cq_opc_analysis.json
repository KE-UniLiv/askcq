        "rationale": "1. **Concepts:** The question explicitly mentions \"artifact\" as a key entity. The phrase \"all information (cataloguing, provenance, condition, display, loan)\" implies a related concept encompassing these details, thus \"LoanInformation.\"\n2. **Properties:** The information types listed within parentheses (cataloguing, provenance, etc.) are treated as properties of the \"LoanInformation\" concept.\n3. **Relationships:** The question implies a connection between an artifact and its associated loan information. This is represented by the \"hasLoanInformation\" relationship.\n4. **Filters:** The phrase \"added via the loan process\" acts as a filter on the \"Artifact\" concept, specifying how the artifact was acquired.\n5. **Cardinality Hint:** The question asks for information related to \"a single artifact,\" indicating a single result.\n6. **Aggregation Hint:** The question does not involve counting or any other aggregation operations."
