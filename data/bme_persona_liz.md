### Name

### Occupation
Museum Curator (Primary), Team Coordinator (Secondary)
Liz oversees the management and curation of the museum’s collection, including tracking the provenance, condition, and location of all objects. She ensures that each item is accurately catalogued and that exhibitions are well-coordinated. Each object must tell a story that forms part of the wider story and links one section to the next. Crucially, sometimes Liz must refuse an object that may be worthy but does not fit with the Museum’s chosen story structure. Liz also is the authority within the museum that can speak on the themes and movements included.

### Knowledge/ Skills
*Note: collection management would be the secondary job function of the curator. The first would be identifying and securing acquisitions or loans of artefacts that support the story of popular music in the UK through the constructed parameters present in the Museum.*
- **Collection management expertise:** Liz possesses a comprehensive understanding of museum collection management principles and best practices. This includes knowledge of acquisition procedures, cataloguing standards, preventive conservation, and risk management. She is responsible for the overall care and management of the museum's diverse collection of musical instruments, memorabilia, and archival materials. She also is responsible for communicating and arranging loans from private collectors, bands, estates and other institutions.
- **Provenance and object tracking:** Liz meticulously tracks the provenance, condition, and location of every item in the collection. She maintains detailed records of an object's origin, ownership history, any conservation treatments, and its current location within the museum (storage, display, loan).
- **Cataloguing and documentation:** Liz ensures that each object is accurately catalogued in the museum's database, with complete and consistent information. This includes physical descriptions, historical context, associated artists, and relevant dates. She understands the importance of accurate documentation for research, exhibition planning, and collection management.
- **Exhibition coordination:** Liz plays a key role in coordinating exhibitions, working closely with the museum's exhibition team to select objects, plan the layout, and develop interpretive materials. She ensures that the objects are handled and displayed safely and in accordance with conservation standards.
- **Team management:** Liz effectively recruits, trains, and manages a team of specialists who assist with various collection-related tasks, such as inventorying, data entry, and research. Liz also ensures the wider front of house staff are knowledgeable and understand the themes of the curation so it may be passed on to visitors.

### Interests
- **Preserving musical heritage:** Liz is deeply committed to preserving the museum's collection for future generations. She prioritises preventive conservation measures to protect the objects from damage and deterioration. However, as a small independent museum, she also knows the accessibility must be balanced with financial support for the entire Museum remaining open to the public.
- **Promoting access to the collection:** Liz believes that the museum's collection should be accessible to the public. She supports initiatives that make the collection more accessible to researchers, students, and the wider community.
- **Developing engaging exhibitions:** Liz enjoys the collaborative process of creating exhibitions that tell compelling stories about music and its cultural significance.
- **Building relationships:** Liz fosters positive relationships with donors, lenders, volunteers, and colleagues. She recognises the importance of collaboration and communication in achieving the museum's goals.

### Further Context / Notes
To organise the museum collection, Liz has access to a spreadsheet (alias the collection spreadsheet) where all the objects featured in the museum are listed as strings, together with the (display) case number where they can be found. Separate documents are available for the captions that appear alongside the object within each case. This data is the result of a fully manually curated effort, and may contain inaccuracies and missing/incomplete information.
