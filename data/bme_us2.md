# (S2) Orchestrating the Museum Floor: Collection Management

### Personas

### Goal
**Keywords:** internal collection management, object location tracking, exhibition planning, multimedia association, display case assignment

Liz needs a system to efficiently manage the museum's collection internally, focusing on precise object location tracking, associating multimedia resources whenever these are available, and optimising exhibition planning. Items are displayed in “display cases”, each of which belongs to a specific “zone” or “area” at the museum. A zone at the BME refers to a musically meaningful time period (see the image on the right for an example).

### Scenario
As the museum curator, Liz oversees a diverse and dynamic collection. Her primary challenge is maintaining accurate, real-time knowledge of each object's location and status within the museum. This includes:
- **Pinpointing object locations:** Instantly knowing which display case an item is in, if it's in storage, undergoing conservation, or being prepared for an upcoming exhibition.
- **Managing display case assignments:** Efficiently assigning objects to specific display cases, optimising space, and ensuring thematic coherence within exhibitions.
- **Associating multimedia:** Linking objects to relevant images, videos, and textual information for on-site displays and interactive experiences.
- **Planning exhibitions:** Having a clear overview of available objects, their locations, and any planned movements to facilitate exhibition planning and object selection.

Currently, Liz relies on a combination of spreadsheets, paper records, and a legacy database system. This approach may be cumbersome and error-prone, especially when dealing with frequent object movements and updates.

An integrated collection management system would streamline Liz's workflow and improve the museum's internal collection management. This system would provide:
- **Precise location tracking:** Real-time tracking of each object's location within the museum, including specific display case assignments (e.g., Case 2, 3, 4), storage locations, and temporary movements (conservation, photography, etc.).
- **Visual floor plan:** An interactive museum floor plan that visually represents the location of each object, making it easy to understand the current layout and plan object movements.
- **Multimedia association:** A seamless way to link objects to related images, videos, audio recordings, and textual information (museum labels, exhibition descriptions, artist biographies) for use in on-site displays and interactive kiosks.
- **Exhibition planning tools:** Features to assist with exhibition planning, including object selection, location management, and scheduling of object movements.

### Questions
- How will the system track the movement of objects within the museum, providing a clear history of location changes?
- Will the system provide a visual representation of the museum floor plan, allowing Liz to easily see the location of each object and manage display case assignments?
- How will the system facilitate the association of multimedia content with specific objects, ensuring that the correct resources are linked and easily accessible?
- Will the system allow for different access levels, so that curators, conservators, and other staff can access and update relevant information?
- How will the system support the planning and scheduling of exhibitions, including the management of object movements and display case assignments?
- Can the system generate reports on the location history of objects and their inclusion in past exhibitions?
