Sonia wants to seamlessly loan valuable and iconic items from her collection to the BME, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer and automatic generation of metadata to enrich the museum's knowledge base.

### Scenario
Sonia is passionate about sharing her collection with the public. She recognises the BME as an ideal institution to showcase her items and contribute to their mission of preserving British music heritage. The traditional process of loaning objects to museums can be cumbersome, involving extensive paperwork, back-and-forth communication, and potential delays. A new system has been implemented at the BME to facilitate knowledge exchange and to enable the automatic creation of metadata that feeds directly to the museum’s knowledge systems.

Sonia proactively reaches out to the BME, expressing her interest in loaning a selection of her music memorabilia. She meticulously compiles the details of these items, including their history, significance, multimedia content (images, videos, audio recordings, when available), current condition, and the proposed loan terms. This comprehensive information is then shared with the BME through her preferred communication channels, such as email.

Upon receiving this information, Liz carefully reviews each item. Recognising their potential value to the museum's collection, a selection of items is identified. Liz then utilises the BME dashboard to systematically add each item to the knowledge base. Liz diligently ensures that all the details provided by Sonia are accurately captured within the system. When adding a new item to the collection, various information of the artefact is collected, including: cataloguing information, provenance, condition, display requirements, loan agreements, etc. Some of these attributes apply to every item; while others are more specific to their type (e.g. the brand and type of a guitar). Some Example Data is provided in the subsection below for reference.

A key aspect of this process is that Sonia is granted (limited) access to the dashboard. This empowers her to maintain an ongoing overview of her loaned items, including the status of loan agreements, ensuring transparency and facilitating clear communication between her and the museum. Overall, this streamlined workflow eliminates much of the manual effort and potential for errors associated with traditional loan processes. By enabling Sonia to directly contribute to the museum's knowledge base, the system facilitates efficient knowledge transfer and ensures the accurate documentation of her valuable items.

These examples demonstrate the range of information that needs to be captured and managed for each loaned item. The new system should be able to accommodate this level of detail and provide a clear, organised way to track and communicate this information.

### Questions
- How will the system capture and store the complex history and significance of iconic items, ensuring that this information is accurately communicated to museums?
- How will the system facilitate the creation of condition reports, including the ability to upload photographs and annotate specific areas of an item?
- How will the system track the movement of loaned items between different museums and exhibitions, providing a clear audit trail?
- Will the system record the display requirements and care instructions for each item, ensuring its proper handling and preservation?
